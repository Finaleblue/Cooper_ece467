She even explained the 3 different type of sauces available &general info about Lucille's. She started us off with freshly baked biscuits. These were no ordinary biscuits though. Some may argue that the bread was \"hard\" but I felt that it was necessary to have them a bit sturdy rather than having them fall apart. It had butter and some type of sugar? on top. Not sure what it was but it was something different and definitely tasty! Their sweet tea was good too, all their drinks were served in mason jars btw, so hipsters rejoice. Also note that they do serve their drinks in shareable portions. \n\nOnto the food: We got the \"BBQ Lunch Platter\" [$16]. Came with baby back ribs (3 bones, normal or St. Louis rub) AND \"your choice of two of the following: pulled pork, brisket burnt ends, tri tip, hot link, rib tips or one quarter smoked chicken\" (from the website) PLUS a side. I opted with the normal baby back ribs- juicy and fall of the bones type- & brisket as well as tri tip. All great choices! Their mac & cheese was cheeeesy just the way I like it. Tasted their potato salad too, Phil's won in that department by a long shot. Now in terms of sauces, Phil's has more of the tangy-spicy taste whereas Lucille's has the tangy-sweet taste which I liked better.. In terms of size & tenderness, I feel like Phil's is better.

However, I think everyone else knows this too, so those days after clubbing when you're finally able to roll out of bed and your hunger finally outweighs your need to lay in bed and you think man I need some pho, best of luck to you on the wait situation. If you're lucky and it happens to be short, you are in luck! But I've seen the wait be up through 45 minutes before as well. Longest 45 minutes if you are already barely at the state of crawling out of bed. The restaurant is pretty big and has lots of tables and service is fast, it's just THAT many ppl want to get some. \n\nPHO: The broth is very well made, this is pretty much the defining difference between pho restaurants and pho kim long is near the top of the list. I don't like it when place don't rinse the starch off their noodles and makes the broth cloudy, none of that here. Good portions of noodle and meat, yes! Also, no crazy obvious msg taste, here we go baby! Path to recovering so you can go hard again!\n\nI used to take good pho for granted, but having experienced some bad ones lately, I really appreciate those that stay true to the craft! \n\nLOCATION: If you are staying around the wynn/venetian side of the strip, you just go right across spring mountain a few blocks and you are in chinatown, not too far of a drive to get some tasty vietnamese beef broth in your system.", "type": "review", "business_id": "FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw"}

People were happy, having a great time, and wearing a mix of all sorts of interesting costumes.  \n\nDrinks and Food:  Both were good, and there were plenty of choices.  It was however very, very expensive.  This is to be expected to a degree when you go to a festival, fair, concert, or anything the like.  However, given the ticket prices for various events, I think the peripherals were a bit too much.  \n\nEntertainment:  Great all around.  There was everything you could think of, and all sorts of music on multiple stages, to keep everyone entertained, no matter what their musical taste.  From 80s music to Hip Hop.  Everything was in reasonable walking distance between acts, and readily accessible.  \n\nOverall, I enjoyed the entire experience.  I especially enjoyed the Friday night, pre-game mixer, where various restaurant and alcohol vendors held a small, but fun social, right next to the container park.  Minus the admission price, food and drinks from all the vendors was free, and it was a great time had by all!

Yes you heard me right. Even I couldn't believe it. A week before our trip, my honey kept talking about this place. Heck, I'm not going to pass up vegan donuts. So after a couple of days in Sin City. We decided to head towards there...location CHINATOWN!! Go figure, right? Just make sure you have CASH on you...NO CREDIT/DEBIT card.\n\nWhen I entered the place, it brought me back to my childhood memories. When my papa would take me to Winchell's donut shop during summer vacation and he would treat me to a raised donut and we would have father-daughter day. This establishment was set up similar to the old donut shops back in the day. \n\nWe met up with the owner (I think) and he indicated the first 2 rows are vegan. Holy heck!! That's a lot to choose from. We tried not to go buckwild crazy the first day, since we had other places we wanted to try out. We enjoyed it so much that on our last day, we brought a dozen home...actually 10 since we ate 2 while in Vegas. The 10 we brought home, didn't even last 12 hours. My dad and mom (supposedly are diabetic and shouldn't have sweets) ate 5 of them like they were chicklets. \n\nSo, if you're in the area regardless if your vegan or not, you gotta stop by this place. They also serve non-vegan donuts. Why bother with those because take it from me (a person who just turned vegan 2 years ago), you will not know the difference. You can't beat the price point ($1-$2each).\n\nRecommendation...Get the CHOCOLATE FILLED CUSTARD, the creamy filling alone can give you ecstasy and that's a good thing in Vegas. If you like apple fillings, get the bear claw with apples filled inside. It was my second favorite. Obviously you can't go wrong with the traditional raised donuts. \n\nMy honey loved it too...http://www.yelp.com/biz/ronalds-donuts-las-vegas?hrid=_cF8WUu3RXVsMisJmzkJRQ", "type": "review", "business_id": "w4SGmsvFzqyAIs7CSQ_J-g"}

Rather than concentrating on the conversation of the person I was dining with at Loch Fyne I spent the entire Sunday lunch peering out of the window and wondering what it would be like to be a lighthouse keeper. It's all the restaurant's fault for having a cool ass location looking out to the sea in Newhaven.\n\nI am really, truly rubbish at making the effort to come down this way, which is pretty shameful. Edinburgh is small...there is no excuse for just staying in the city centre and never leaving. It's worth embarking on the short journey to Loch Fyne because it really is nice to be eating your seafood with a side of actual harbour in front of your eyes. Loch Fyne itself is housed within pretty awesome premises. It used to be the old fish market so has a definite maritime atmosphere to it, and it was a really chilled place to enjoy Sunday lunch, particularly with the sun shining into the bright and airy space.\n\nWe shared two starters - mussels, always a winner if the cream and white wine sauce is on point, which it was, and crab ravioli with lemon butter sauce and rocket salad. The ravioli filling was tasty, but if there's anything I'm fussy about it's pasta, and I personally felt it needed a couple of pinches more salt...but then I do like my pasta well-salted, other people might not be so concerned with that. The main was awesome, primarily because a) it was delicious and b) it was lobster. Lobster, if it's fresh and cooked just to perfection with the simple addition of garlic butter is just immense, and always worth the extra spend if you're out for a nice lunch anyway. We also sampled the scallops and black pudding main, and although I'm never really the first to opt for black pudding, I did enjoy this classic combination, with the scallops, like the lobster, being cooked splendidly.\n\nAll in all, a really lovely lunch. Our waiter was a cool dude too. I skipped off to peruse the lighthouse afterwards, and all was well.", "type": "review", "business_id": "C0fGT8K2woAeodsJgia0hg"}

Everything was was good quality and well prepared (and fast!) and the price was very reasonable. My wife and I both ordered the 1/4 rotisserie chicken (white) which came with cornbread and two sides. I got the baked beans and the special: spicy mac & cheese. The first thing I tried was the cornbread, and found it had jalape\u00f1os and whole kernels of corn baked in. I know some people really like the whole corn in the cornbread thing, but I'd rather keep my breads and vegetables separate. Next up was the spicy mac & cheese. I love mac & cheese, and I've become a big fan of having a bit of hot sauce added to give it some kick, so I was really excited about this. It certainly had the spicy; it had lots of jalape\u00f1os mixed in and was quite hot. What it was lacking was the cheese. There was no creaminess to it at all. The baked beans, however, were very good. They also had jalape\u00f1os mixed in (are you sensing a theme here?), but only had a subtle kick which was balanced with a slightly sweet tangy sauce. As for the chicken, the flavor was excellent but most of the breast was pretty dry. The wing, on the other hand, was quite juicy. If you're looking for really moist chicken you might have better luck with the dark meat. There were no jalape\u00f1os in the chicken.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Po3kpjcdRfLgtMUhmoK9Aw"}

The more expensive rice dishes aren't worth it, in my opinion.\n- Good variety of veggie dishes, though two are a bit greasy (the Baigan Bharta and Bhindi Masala) and they don't have Mushroom Masala.\n- Paneers are all very delicious, especially the Paneer Makhani and Paneer Rajastani which are exceptional.\n- If you want them, you'll need to ask for the complimentary Papadum (those thin lentil chips you can snack on before your meal arrives).  They used to always be provided without asking but they apparently stopped doing that; however, they are happy to provide them upon request.\n\nThe establishment:\n- Plates and silverware are very nice, NOT cheap\n- Seats are well-cushioned, high quality, and comfortable.  Nice tables.\n- Bathrooms have above average furnishings (granite counters, stone tiled walls)\n- Good overall furnishings, subdued lighting, not too loud; excellent for a date or conversation\n- Music is usually appropriate though once they were oddly playing 80's music\n\nThe service:\n- There is never a long wait for our food, even when they are relatively busy\n- Some of the waiters are a little on the reserved side (maybe it's an Indian thing?), but all of them are always very polite, friendly and eager to please without being overbearing.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qpptyM9Dfns3AW5E_lsu6Q"}

Now Vietnamese restaurants aren't known for their service but this place was amazingly bad. Our server never once asked us if we wanted refills, and it took nearly a half an hour to get our Pho. For those not in the know, Pho is extremely easy to make once you have the broth. It should only take 10 minutes or so to have this ready, TOPS. \n\nIf you think I'm off my rocker do yourself a favor and visit one of these:\nKhai Hoan (the best), Da Vang (really good), and Cyclo (kind of over rated, but this place puts Dragonfly to shame ).", "type": "review", "business_id": "Qa6Gmw6OcNKrqVDh80I_9w"}

I knew, no matter what we tried, that we'd be kicked off the table and forced to awkwardly stand at the bar until the place turns into a club.\n\nBesides that, a few positives:\n- Service: Our waitress was very attentive and patient. We asked a million questions about the menu and took a while to get organized and order. One of the orders was wrong when she brought it out, so a new plate plus complimentary side vegetables promptly arrived.\n- Dessert: We got all of the desserts and shared. Literally, every single one was incredible and a must-have. In addition to the ones we ordered, we also got a complimentary tiramisu for the engagement of one of my friends. Awesome.\n- Shots: We were kicked off the table around 10pm (nice grace period) but offered a round of shots at the bar to make up for it - nice touch.\n\nThe negatives, however, really left their impression:\n- Food: I was not impressed - and especially so given the price. The fish and meat dishes were small, overly salty and sparse with sides/carbs (even when included in the dish). The chicken was ok, the seafood special and other white fish were really bland. The pasta was plentiful but tasted and looked like the sauce came out of a can. Our appetizers were ok - salmon tartare was probably the best bet.\n- Atmosphere: the place used to attract an attractive, fun and energetic group of Montreal locals - people you wanted to be around. It now appears to cater more to tourists (especially younger Americans coming to experience all Montreal has to offer that demographic - need I say more?). It makes for a rather uncomfortable experience for 8 girls who are really just looking for a fun night out together.\n- Bottle service / club switch-over: This was really poorly done - most of the tables remained in the same locations, chairs were scattered in the aisles, waitresses couldn't get by and neither could we! the music didn't encourage dancing and there was a general apathy in the place. Sad. \n\nSave your appetite for La Belle Province post-bar and just come here for bottle service OR come in the late seating and have some apps and dessert and then continue the night at the bar.", "type": "review", "business_id": "VzG3VWLnGCrRaQGgtcmtow"}

This time I got the pulled chicken sandwich with sides of cole slaw and a vegetable medley.  My friend got a four-meat platter.\n\nWe were both quite disappointed.  I expected the chicken to be more flavorful than it was.  I took half the sandwich home and finished it later.  It was edible, but nothing to celebrate.  The cole slaw was just awful.  It tasted sour.  I just took a couple of bites of that and didn't even take the rest of it home with me.   The vegetable medley was okay.\n\nMy friend's opinion of the four-meat platter was that it was a one-note dish.  All the meats she chose (chicken, beef brisket, pork burnt tips, and Louisiana ribs) tasted pretty much the same.  Like the chicken on my sandwich, they were not well-sauced, and you couldn't escape the overly-pungent smokiness of the dish.\n\nI tasted one of her pork burnt tips and was put off by the smoked flavor myself.\n\nLesson learned.

The food started out well as the soups were quite good. The hot & sour soup was fairly spicy and is a good deal. The wonton soup was also tasty with a flavorful broth and big wontons. The egg rolls were decent but not too crispy. The crab rangoons were pretty bland and boring and all you can taste is the cream cheese.\nThe big problem was the quality of the entrees. Maybe we made a mistake with what we ordered but we didn't have a single decent entree. The chicken in garlic sauce didn't taste like garlic at all. All we could taste was a mild ginger flavor. The General Tso's chicken had a standard sauce and the pieces of chicken were big but the soggy breading was unsightly and I had to peel it off. The Kung Pao chicken tasted like spicy chicken soup. And last but not least, the beef with broccoli had no flavor whatsoever.\nAll in all, a sad experience and I'll continue my search for half decent Chinese food in Pittsburgh.", "type": "review", "business_id": "m7cT_avH6bvwUz4f1VgZUA"}

Granted, it was a weeknight but in New York there are lights on all the time. I couldn't even make up the shape of the skyline because it was pitch black. This is not the fault of the stadium but of a small city.

Really?!  Decided to pass on the early check in and waited till the end of my day to go check in.  \n\nAfter being scolded for pulling into the wrong valet lane so I could unload my suitcase and check in (I should have been in the common folk lane, not the super duper multi-star lane), I checked in for a two night stay.  Finally got checked in and headed to my room.  The bathroom area has a nice seated vanity area, but THERE WAS NO MIRROR over it.  Clearly there should have been because you could see the spots on the wall where there used to be adhesive.  Got past that.  Was happy to see that there was a Keurig coffee maker on the counter near the vanity.\n\nThe next morning I got up and went to make a cup of coffee.  Realized there was no coffee nor coffee condiments on the counter.  I called housekeeping and they advised that there IS coffee, but it is part of the honor bar and there is a charge if you use.  Are you kidding me?!  Another \"amenity\" that they want to nickel-and-dime-you-to-death with.  \n\nOnce ready to head out I decided to leave the \"do not disturb\" on the door as I didn't feel like securing all my valuables and computer.  Come back after a long day, slip off my shoes and am getting comfortable.  Head into the restroom area and catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror over the vanity.  Wait a minute - there WAS no mirror over the vanity this morning!  Apparently the housekeeping and engineering staff decided to completely disregard my \"DO NOT DISTURB\" on the door and help themselves to my room, while all my personal belongings, valuables and electronics were out in the open!  I felt violated, unsafe and totally pissed off.  When I called the front desk to complain, they asked if I'd like someone from housekeeping to contact me.  Why?  Why would I want that?!  The customer relations person I spoke to were less than sympathetic nor concerned.   I slept uneasy that night, and vowed I will never step foot into that place again.  I didn't find anything missing but that is besides the point.  They had no right in my room when I asked for privacy.\n\nAnd the icing on the cake of the mirror suddenly appearing in my room was that they didn't even bother to clean it after they installed it!  There were smudges and hand prints all over it.  Nice.\n\nSo if you decide to stay here - make sure you lock up your stuff even if you have the \"Do Not Disturb\" placquard showing.

It is not about creating more sprawl.  \n\nYes, the new Boxes that have been plopped down are nice due to the context within; but this is far from something to sings odes of joy about.  We don't need any more glorified, \"luxury\" strip centers.  I agree with Jean K's assessment of the situation entirely.  This design was just plopped in place and the only local flavor is the bridge that was present.  Where is the thought?  Where is the design?   We can see this Anywhere, USA.\n\nHaving said that, though, I will return because the Waterfront does house certain big box retailers that you can't find in Pittsburgh Proper.

Basically the termites have kept moving all around the house and reappearing elsewhere, rather than the termites ingesting the poison and supposedly kill the base colonies.

See all those 3.5 star reviews for all the overpriced restaurants on the strip.  You know the ones that don't live up to and are more expensive than the original locations in New York and Los Angeles.  The ones that don't really care about how good the food is, because the celebrity chef whose name is on the marquee is at least an entire desert and mountain range away.  Those famous name places in the hotels, they care as much about return customers as those slot machines do.  They both know that as soon as they take your money, the next stooge is going to sit down in that same seat.\n\nBachi Burger belongs on the strip.  It so good and different that it should be featured in the Bellagio or the Wynn, but you aren't going to find it there.  You are going to find it tucked away in a hard to see corner of a strip mall south of the airport.  This gem who MUST expand to other locations, is a concept from Chef Lorin Watada, who has worked for Roy's for many years.  The fusion of Asian flavors and burgers are so perfect together, I have no idea why nobody else has really come up with an entire menu of it before.  Sure you sometimes see a Teriyaki burger on a menu, but this is a completely different level.\n\nWe started off with Peking Style Duck Steamed Buns.  While not listed as an appetizer, they are like 3 mini sliders, so good for sharing.  The buns were nice and sticky and folded taco style around a slice of sweet duck breast, cilantro, slice of egg, thin slice of radish, scallions, black Chinese vinaigrette, and hosin BBQ sauce.  While they were a good starting point, never order them in place of a Burger! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas#3zjM4SbAXTNr8cRrcyHDeg\n\nI split two burgers with my brother.  Both were so good, we couldn't decide which one we liked better.  First was the Ronin Burger.  7oz of Angus beef topped with caramelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, a fried egg, miso goma dressing, and katsu BBQ sauce.  On the side was yuzu citrus aioli.  I also had them add Gruyere cheese.  The burger was cooked a perfect medium rare.  It was nice and pink.  The juices of the burger and the katsu BBQ sauce went so perfectly together I couldn't distinguish them as separate entities anymore.  The Japanese cabbage slaw had a nice crunchy sweet vinegar flavor to offset the texture of the burger.  I'm usually not a huge fan of a fried egg on my burger, but this just seemed so right.  So many times, burger joints throw on a fried egg for \"shock value\".  Somehow on this burger it was tastefully done to enhance the burger.  The miso goma sauce was on the slaw side of the bun.  The sweet rice wine/ sesame flavor worked perfectly with the slaw.  At this point my taste buds were just singing.  How could you need more flavor?  What was this yuzu citrus aioli about?   I added some of it just on one bite, and  found that the burger really didn't need it at all.  In fact that was the opinion I had about every side of sauce served with each item.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas#8s5ab8tv_OI9keGxjmPErw\n\nThe second burger may have been even better!  More unique in flavor for sure.  The Banh-Mi Burger.  Ok, brace yourselves.  The patty is made up of...ground angus beef, pork, shrimp, pork pate, lemongrass, and plenty of other herbs and spices.   It was topped with pickled carrots & radish, cilantro, curry aioli, and lettuce.  The nuoc mam dipping sauce (fish sauce with lime, garlic, vinegar, etc..) was served in a large bowl on the side.  Plenty of room to dip your burger in the bowl.  But once I did that, I felt the strong sauce covered up the wonderful flavor of the burger.  Again we had it medium rare and the juices were everywhere.  For those that complain that the burgers are too juicy and the bun can get soggy....Eat it faster!!!  I actually thought the bun held up well.  A burger that tastes this good, isn't going to last long on my plate.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas#ETcasvkOZaGaNUM3ZVIoQA\n\nA burger isn't complete without some fries.  We had the Truffle Parmesan Fries, which were enough to share.  This isn't your usual truffle oil just poured on the fries, it's black truffle porcini cream.  WOW it was great, but not very much of it.  I wonder if you can get extra of it on your fries if you are willing to pay more.  The fries were perfectly cooked and sliced thin.  Topped with a small amount of slightly melted parmesan cheese.  Really after you got past the the top layer of fries, there wasn't much topping left, so share nicely everyone!   We stayed away from the Sun Dried Tomato Aioli dipping sauce as the flavor overpowered a much superior flavor of the fries.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas#z7-52AroniBC5F63yI0D4A\n\nNothing left to say other than GO NOW!", "type": "review", "business_id": "PXviRcHR1mqdH4vRc2LEAQ"}

However, this did not make them immune because within the next three days my kids got sick too.  Luckily they eat like Mice so they did not get the full dose; like myself.  It was not a virus folks -I did the research;  It can take 72 hours to have Salmonella surface. Not to mention; No one else that I have been around has gotten sick.... I told the restaurant and they sent me to security... REALLY!  They filled out an incident report.  Guess what? Nothing has been done. Are you shocked? I knew they were ignoring me when I called back to tell them about the kids and he said \"I will add them to my report.\"... He didn't ask for age, weight or specifications...

It is mostly about my children, as I am a bit of a grump when it comes to dental care, but therein lies the ultimate positive experience. \n\nEarly last year my wife and I started the difficult task of finding a good dentist for our children, as their previous dentist had recently closed business and moved out of the Valley. In a nutshell, and through the guidance of a great pediatric doctor/friend of ours, we found our way to Ocotillo. \n\nUpon our first contact with the front office manager, Ana, we had quickly determined this was the place for us. We were treated with the utmost respect and care. We walked in the door and were greeted with a smile and a good morning. After the initial (usual) paperwork, my daughter was taken back to the room. She was reluctant at first and didnt want to go to the back, but was convinced when Ana got up and spoke to her, down on her knee to speak to her level, and told her that she would hold her hand through the whole thing!! I thought \"but doesnt she have the front to deal with?\" As she walked to the back to help my daughter, a gentleman in the typical scrub top and bottom (sorry, i dont remember his name), came out and helped with the front phone. After about a minute and a half, Ana came back to the front and gave us the thumbs up, like she was saying \"She's good\". Then we met the Dr. She was a very sweet woman and very careful to explain what was going on in my daughter's mouth and the treatment she was recommending for her. Dr. Annamareddy (hope I spelt it correct) was respectful, very good with my daughter, and not only spoke to us, but, like Ana, spoke directly to my daughter and gave her a pat on the back and said great job taking care of your teeth! My daughter walked away with a smile, a little gift from the treasure box, and her own new toothbrush and toothpaste. \n\nSince this visit, we have taken our other two children, my sister in law's family, my brothers kids, and finally, myself. It truly was a great experience and i finally broke down and had my teeth looked at. \n\nUltimately, I have found this group of professionals to be just that. Professional. They are very respectful, accomodating and great with patients. We are confident that we will stay with Dr. Suneeta Annamareddy for as long as she wants to practice. Thank you Dr. Annamareddy and Ana, for winning over this grump\n\nMarc-", "type": "review", "business_id": "a-jNTF8rf-AcczfsTgfqTA"}

These pubs seem like every other generic, chain-looking venue that I've seen in every other state I've been to so I don't know what makes them \"Nevada styled\" but whatever. Anyway, today's pub in question is Steiner's, not really a spot that was on my radar for any reason until someone recently suggested it. And I must say, once again I was a bit surprised.\n\nAs I said earlier, the interior is pretty typical for a 'pub'; dark wood floors, dark wood tables, and a ton of neon beer signs. But I don't think you're ever going to one of these places for the ambiance. The menu has pretty much anything you can think of in the genre of American comfort food, and their website actually claims it is 'sophisticated' at that. Click the link for the full menu rundown as it's too much to list here. Speaking just about burgers, they offer a few great sounding choices mostly named after casinos on the strip. They all sound pretty good, and I'll potentially be going back to try a couple others.\n\nThis time around I decided to skip the casino themes and go with the Kobe burger: \"beer fed, hand massaged and sake brushed beef served on a sweet sourdough bun with Maui onions and aged white cheddar cheese, heirloom tomato and leaf lettuce.\" What came out looked somewhat unassuming, but tasted fantastic. The Kobe had terrific flavor and was cooked perfectly. The orange-colored heirloom tomato was a great touch; I only wish it was a tiny bit bigger so it could stand out more. The cheese was melted, a bit too subtle but good. The Maui onions were sweet and great, but a bit too much for me so I pulled them out halfway through. The bun was super dense, soft and delicious. Almost like a Hawaiian sweet roll and a sourdough had a baby. Overall this was a fantastic burger, and a total surprise.\n\nThe fries were good too. I didn't like the a-la-carte option or the $4.39 price tag, but you do get quite a lot for the price. Some slightly undercooked for my taste but good overall. What isn't good is that my burger, fries and drink came to $22.39 which is way too high for a single burger meal in a local's spot, even if it is a great burger. With a price point like that it's still tough to fight with the price of something like the Dispensary Lounge even if it is a damn good burger.", "type": "review", "business_id": "lzl3cfgVEGMtezF8oRqXDA"}

(My take on it)\nThought that the bacon and eggs breakfast should come with more than two wimpy pieces of bacon.\nThought it was outrageous that our breakfast came with a biscuit but to add a side of gravy was almost 3 dollars!

After a short wait, we met Tom Sullivan who took us out into the massive warehouse area where he had positioned a couple of slabs that were the Cafe Creme we had selected at Pulte's Design Center. After choosing the one we liked best, he had the fork lift guys bring in 4 more that were from that batch. We approved all 4 and that was that. I have to say that the process was simple, very informative and took less time than we expected. Tom was amazing and spent the time we had waiting for each slab to be brought in, explaining where the granite was mined, how it was shipped, the various minerals it contained and the process it would go through after we finished.

I'm a massage junkie and they provide one of the best massages that I've ever received. \n\nThings to know:\n1. Book the one hour foot massage. This is a fully clothed massage so wear workout clothes. If you're coming after work and don't have any, they have doctor type scrubs you can wear.\n2. They start off soaking your feet in warm water and then massage your head, neck, arms, and hands. Then they give you a long foot and leg massage. From there you get flipped over into your stomach and they stretch your legs and lower back. Then my favorite part (mainly because my neck and upper back are knot city) is the neck and back massage. I've seen many massage therapists to help this issue and none of them have even gotten close to how well the ladies at Thai Royal do. They will get over me and put everything they have into it!\n3. This place is a steal. They recently raised their prices from $35 an hour but who cares. Make sure you tip at least $10. \n4. My personal favorites are Noi and Sana. They both do a phenomenal job and are better than the rest in my opinion (and I've seen quite a few).", "type": "review", "business_id": "SgSv46U_dBf7qbPZy6h0aw"}

Especially since the ATM charges $2 to withdraw money.  I really think in an age where the fees charged to restraunts for debit cards are nominal they should at least accept those.\n\nMy husband ordered the Lake Louie scotch ale which is a nice brew, they have a nice beer selection. \n\n The bar is cozy and it was a fun place to eat.

This item should be served on a thicker crust or Indian Fry Bread. Aside from the soggyness, the flavor was very good. \n\nThe rice was different from what I'm used too. It was green in color with corn and green chilies. Tasted fine but I really like the regular rice better.\n\nDaughter order 3 chicken tacos, rice and beans which was a shocker BC 99.8% of the time she gets a cheese crisp. .

It would be great in the summer. The server was great at explaining all of the dishes in English even though he was busy. At Liverpool house, go big or go home.\n\nWe tried the breakfast foie gras, grilled clams, Brussels sprouts and horse tartare for appetizers. The stand outs were the brussel sprouts and breakfast foie gras. The brussel sprouts were deep fried and doused in a spicy honey sauce. Addicting. The breakfast foie gras was pretty much a meal in itself and everything melded so well together. I would return just for that dish. The grilled clams were a tad fishy. The horse tartare wasn't too bad. I wasn't sure what to expect but was surprised at how lean and tender it tasted. I expected the texture to be more tough. I would've preferred more seasoning and smaller pieces. \n\nOur mains consisted of the lobster spaghetti, rainbow trout, duck and steak. The lobster spaghetti was massive-buttery and rich. The steak was decent but not out of this world. The duck was solid although I'm not sold on the pairing with olives. The trout cooked perfectly and tasted great with the butter sauce. They served mashed potatoes with peas for the table which tasted great with the butter sauce from the trout. Stand alone it was fine but unnecessary since the portions were huge. \n\nSolid restaurant but I did feel slightly disappointed.

The food ranges mediocre to downright bland, which wouldn't be so bad if it weren't so overpriced. I'm sorry, but $20 for a flatbread that's half the size of a pizza? Is it supposed to be an entr\u00e9e, or a joke? $25 for a plate of spaghetti? Even if the pasta is handmade (and I don't think it is) that's crazy. The wine list is pretty ok, but this isn't the only place in Pittsburgh to drink wine, and I can guarantee you that anywhere else you choose would have better food. \n\nI'd probably be more forgiving of the lack-luster menu if it weren't for other factors. Because the real downfall at Pino's is the owner, Joe. This man has no tact, no grace--and judging by the food, absolutely no talent in the kitchen. I've been to Pino's a handful of times, as it's near my home, and honestly, I really wanted to like it. But each time I've been in, I'm surprised by the extent of this man's unprofessionalism. He has a very large presence and is very outgoing, but not in the way you want. You'll notice from other reviews that he does not take kindly to criticism. If you don't like something you ordered, keep your mouth shut or be prepared for a debate over the quality of the product. I've even witnessed him making racist comments about his diners--for example, I overheard him one evening saying he was glad that two \"asian\" customers had come in that night, \"because they're good tippers.\" I don't know how they didn't hear him, because the dining room isn't that big, and this guy doesn't know how to keep his voice down. \n\nThat was pretty much the last straw for me. The amount of pride Joe and his staff seem to have in their restaurant is completely disproportionate to the quality of food, and certainly their customer service.

Parties are only seated together. While we were checking in for our reservation, I overhead the hostess taking a call from a customer that wanted a table for the same night.  If you want to eat at SW, I HIGHLY recommend that you make a reservation well in advance of your desired dining date. We waited for our friends in the bar/lounge area.  The cocktail prices were not excessive and made to order (I can tell if the servers are paying attention because I always start off with a Bombay Sapphire Martini, up, in a very cold glass, dry like the desert, with three (3) olives. If any part of that order is wrong it is usually an omen for the rest of the experience).  \n\nBecause the weather outside was cold (in the low 50's) we were given the option of dining on the patio or inside.  Our party of six chose to dine inside.  I would like to point out that SW does not start with an automatic gratuity until the party size reaches eight (8) this was a nice surprise (even though our tips usually are higher).  Each of the meals was prepared to perfection and the service was outstanding.  My wife and I had the porterhouse for two and it was served resting on vegetables.  The table ordered a few sides to share that the amount of food was actually too much.  Some of our party ended taken food back to their suite.  The wine selection is sophisticated and complete (some of the accompanying prices are sophisticated as well).  Not everyone in our party was drinking wine so one of the spouses suggested to the waiter that they bring something out in the $100-$150 range.  The selection was excellent for our preparation. \n\nI would recommend this dining experience to anyone who enjoys a great steakhouse.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5rDosv0aIBhLg81IMSnlyg"}

I've shopped here many, many times, the store lay out is great and very convenient and there's ALWAYS plenty of 10 for $10 deals, a Smiths staple. The bread, condiments, canned foods, etc are located pretty direct to where the entrance is, same for the current best deals, the Starbucks mini cafe, and the vegetables and such. Very convenient for when you need to run in, grab something, and then run back home to food cooking. They have all the \"health foods\" and organic stuff in it's own section right next to the bakery/deli and the alcohol section which is also on the side of the store closest to the door. Again, super convenient.\nThis smith's location also happens to be one where you can bag your own granola, flax seeds, cranberries, etc. This is a section that I have yet to see at any Smiths store or grocery store other than Whole Foods. They also have City Life placed by the exit, a favorite of mine which I definitely prefer picking up on a grocery store trip rather than going inside a gas station. And speaking of gas stations, this location has a Smiths gas station out in the parking lot with plenty of pumps. So you can go shop, win big on the deals, and then go out and cash in your Smiths points at the pump. One time when I came to fill up they took a dollar off the price per gallon because I had so many points on my card.\nI also remember coming in late one night and a crew was actually filming at one of the registers with the whole lights set up and everything.\nSeriously, this grocery store is very cool! \nI've never really felt excited about going to a grocery store but this one makes my life so much easier than I would expect it to!", "type": "review", "business_id": "UEEuS9C0k2VxdXj4LI-BMg"}

Our first go around we loaded up with eggs, hash browns, bacon, sausage, biscuits and gravy, etc. and not one single thing was hot. Not even warm. Cold. That is not the experience you expect when going to a buffet. We left most of that food on our plates and made a second trip to see if maybe we just needed to stir things around or pick from the bottom of the trays, try getting things from a different area - but arrived back at our table to find the second round cold as well. Boo!\n\nHighly disappointing experience, since everything tasted good - those biscuits and gravy would have been a delight - but who wants to eat cold eggs and meat for breakfast? Which left us wondering too how safe the food was if it isn't kept at a proper temperature! \n\nThey had a decent selection and variety, and for the price I'm sure it would be a good value if the food was actually edible.

My problem was that they didn't know about the ingredients of their dishes. As I am vegetarian I don't eat Parmesan cheese as it has rennet in it (calves stomach lining) but the dishes labeled with a \"v\" pretty much all had Parmesan in them. I ended up playing it safe with a pizza as they couldn't conform some ingredients.

The color scheme is just how you remember it growing up, or how your grandma's house was: orange, green, brown, and beige -- the lighting and furniture is all very retro cool. On a nice hot day, the pool has tons of bikini babes (erase Grandma image, I'm talking BABES), dudes, and the drinks are fully-flowing.  Want a quite and serene stay -- don't come here!  It can get quite loud.\n\nParking is easy, but the walk/drive to the rooms feels like your making your way thru a large apartment complex. The rooms decor continue the 70's theme with a low profile bed, modern desk and furniture...and a B&W TV without a remote (kidding!  nice flatscreen).  The bathroom, the sink and counter, really small...but again, oh so cool.  \n\nThis is definitely a party place.

I don't understand what people are saying about the drinks being too sweet, I think they are perfectly sweetened; and if you would prefer your drinks to be not too sweet, they easily accommodate to your needs if you want it to be less sweet!

Once my pizza was ready I headed home.\n\nThe large pizza was good the two pepperoni pizza were absolutely terrible.  The pizza were now cold, soggy , and once again unappetizing.

Okay, so I was a bit skeptical to go here just because they are known for their desserts and chocolate, which I am not a big fan of. Maribel T. had made reservations at 11:00 to meet up with her BFF one last time before we head back to Cali. We came here on a Saturday morning and they were pretty busy. I got the cream cheese with bacon and tomato bagel.Loved it, I mean you can't really mess that up, right? Maribel's sister ordered some waffle fries, I had a few and dipped it with the dipping sauce it came with and it was soo freaking delish, Yumm Yum-Yum! Loved it!! (forget about ranch!)\n\nAfter having our entrees, we got the dessert menu. Maribel T. and her sister ordered the Chocolate Pizza with the works and banana waffle. i really didn't want to try the Chocolate Pizza because it was topped with marshmallows and I hate marshmallows, BUT for some reason I kept eating it. There was something about the Chocolate Pizza, it might have been the hazelnut bits and/or the peanut butter that mixed well with the marshmallows. Yummy Yum-Yum! The banana waffle was just as delish! Maribel T. and I also tried their double machiatto served in their kangaroo cup, my was it strong. haha! \n\nThey also have a small little gift shop where you can purchase their mugs, cups, etc. This place is located in the forum shop across from H&M.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_CHH9KN1bO5cs_GHjQ-r1A"}

Room prices were jacked up ($1.8K for three nights!!) and almost completely booked, but we managed to snag one with a great view of the strip and Bellagio fountain show (34-49).  \n\nThe Cosmo is a very nice hotel; modern, chic, and definitely geared towards the 20s and 30s crowd.  This is a party hotel, so those looking for a more serene (hah!) experience should stay at the Palazzo or Wynn (also favorites of mine).    \n\nLoved the convenience of partying at Marquee Dayclub and Nightclub without having to leave the hotel.  Highlight of my stay here was seeing Armin Van Buuren spin at Marquee Dayclub on Saturday, May 4th; he was awesome!  I've been to Marquee Nightclub many times and enjoy the ambiance; however, still scratching my head over the seemingly endless stairs women have to trek down in order to exit the place!  \n\nOrdered room service for the girls Saturday night and was quoted 1.5 hours, but food arrived within half an hour...pleasant surprise.  The spinach dip with crab and buffalo chicken wings arrived hot, and were pretty tasty - the chips were warm and crispy.  Didn't try the garden salad, but it looked fresh.  \n\nOnly restaurant we had a chance to eat at here was China Poblano, and only because it was next to the Marquee Nightclub and we needed to kill time.  We ordered several dishes to share, including the twenty-vegetable fried rice, siu mai, Open Sesame noodles, and the \"Don't be Jealous\" hot and sour soup.  Well, I ain't jealous of the hot and sour soup; a lot left to be desired.  The Open Sesame noodles were chilled and tasted bland.  The siu mai I didn't try, but my friends claimed it was good.  The highlight of the meal was the fried rice, yes, fried rice!  What made it special was the baby veggies included in the rice, but the rice was pretty flavorful too.  The portions were small, but I'd say the $20 spent on the fried rice was worth it.  It was a bit distracting trying to eat with Marquee's club music blasting our ears, but hey, part of the \"ambiance\".  \n\nLove, love, love the Chandelier bar, especially the second floor, which serves my favorite drink - the Verbena!  It's a tequila based drink, but the special touch is the edible flower bud you eat before you sip your drink.  It's like pop-rocks in your mouth, and your mouth becomes numb for a few minutes, but it totally enhances the flavor of the drink!  I highly recommend this drink!\n\nStaff we encountered during our stay were professional and accommodating - no complaints.

Parking around noon on Saturday was non-existent in the lot behind the restaurant, but no worries. There's free on-street parking on the other side of the light rail. Also, the 35-minute wait only ended up being 15 minutes. Another score!\n\nRather than table bread, Tupelo serves scratch-made biscuits with blueberry jam.

I could've stuffed myself with these biscuits! The food did seem to take awhile, but service was very attentive and gracious.\n\nI chose the Tupelo Farm Fresh Burger with cheddar cheese, lettuce, house-made pickles and a secret sauce along with fried okra and tomatoes. The burger was outstanding, grilled perfectly, tasty, and the secret sauce brought it all together. The okra and tomatoes were fresh, lightly battered with just the right amount of crunch. \n\nDora here. So many choices! But I finally decided on the Charleston Chicken Sandwich, a marinated grilled chicken breast with lettuce, Havarti cheese on sourdough wheat bread with a side of mac-n-cheese. Doesn't that sound great? The chicken was oh-so-tender and juicy, and I really liked the cranberry flavored mayo. First time eating sourdough wheat bread, and I liked it. The mac-n-cheese was creamy with just the right amount of firmness and kick. \n\nI would rate this restaurant 5 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving outstanding food.

Very filling and the bacon bits are really tiny and subtle. \n\nThis place is good for taking a small group of family members or friends as well as date night.

It was before the evening comedy show crowd arrived. This is the reason I listed noise as average, as I wasn't there when live music was playing. \n\nI like the setup of the place, with an outer bar area in an all glass area; gorgeous view of downtown. The interior bar, like the outer bar, has over 50 (I think around 60) taps. They have everything from your mass-brewed American lagers/pilsners (PBR, Bud, Coors, Miller, etc) and a good selection for the beer geek/snob (Sierra Nevada, Stone, Dogfish Head, etc). If you (over several visits) choose to consume one of each, you get two VIP tickets to Stand-Up Live (the attached comedy club). The interior bar area has some different style seating arrangements (booths that face towards the bar, high seat tables, and a nice wraparound bar by all the taps. There are a couple of TVS for sporting events and whatnot, but this is meant more for background sites than to be that place you go to hear the commentators during a game (I don't get the impression this place is meant to be the hangout during the game, but a great after game spot). \n\nThe food was very good, we had a cheese pizza with sun-dried tomatoes, basil oil (tasty). We also got to try a Cuban sandwich pizza; that's right, if you love the pork, cheese (Swiss), and pickles of a Cuban sandwich, you will LOVE this pizza. Overall the beer and food rate from a 4-5. \n\nThe owner (who spoke to me and my friends about our first impressions), Peder the head chef, and the on duty manager (Michelle?) were very friendly and answered all our questions. Breanne (sp?) was a very nice, and knowledgeable server. All of the waitstaff was very nice to my friends and I, even when we started to wear out our welcome. \n\n\nI enjoyed my time here and look forward to going back to complete my beer list. I want to come here during a lunch, and during live music/weekend to make sure I have a complete picture of the place before giving it a five.

Needing a car to get around I decided to use Enterprise Rent-A-Car off of Via De Ventura since its close to where I live.  I spoke with Sam who had their driver Ignacio pick me up and take me to the rental location.  Before I go on, I have to say that Sam and Ignacio were very friendly and helpful; definitely represented Enterprise with their customer service.  Anyway, so after getting to Enterprise I worked with the district manager Mike on renting a car for the whole weekend at a great weekend price of $9.99 - which I thought was a steal.  Mike was very polite and although he offered me the insurance for renting the car, which I obviously declined- Mike was not pushy or rude about it.  Unlike my last experience with Enterprise just a week prior at the Dallas Love Fied location.  The Love Field rental agent irritated me with his pushy antics.  So after having the car for a few hours, my mechanic at Whitey's Auto Repair called and said that my car was fixed and that it wouldn't take the whole weekend.  I was obviously excited, but felt embarassed to have rented the car for the whole weekend and now would have to return it early.  I called and spoke to Mike, who was totally understandable and laughed with me on the phone.  He easily took the car back with no issues and even had their cool driver Ignacio drop me off at the mechanic shop.  Overall I was surprised at the dedication and customer service Mike, Sam and Ignacio offer here at the Via De Ventura location.  This will definitely be my first choice for car rental locations in the Scottsdale area.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Ks7sVzuzMi83wCluloYQOg"}

We had to reschedule our reservation time due to some travel hold ups we had, but they were happy to oblige.  The hostess was very friendly.  We sat at the bar and had a drink while we waited for our table, which she apologized profusely for the customers ahead of us not leaving yet, and continued to update us over the next 10-15 minutes on the status of our table.  It was fine, we were happy to have a drink and talk to the bartender.  He was extremely friendly and gave great wine suggestions.  The other bartender made my drink, a lemon drop martini, which I am a connoisseur of, and it was absolutely delicious.  \n\nWe got our table shortly, a beautiful private booth.  Atmosphere was great.  Lighting was warm, decor contemporary but homey at the same time.  I like how they incorporated subway tile into the floor, but it didn't look grimey or gross like it can sometimes.  Very classical and fit the motif well.  In the booth, you feel like you're the only ones in the restaurant.    \n\nWe ordered champagne, a little overpriced for Korbel (ugh, I hate paying $28 for a bottle of champagne in a restaurant that I would pay less than $10 for in the store). There was a decent selection of wines and a full stocked bar.  \n\nI ordered the wedge salad--highly recommend. Came with a HUGE chunk of fresh blue cheese, and it was sizable.  My fiance ordered ordered a caesar salad, and said it was the best caesar salad he's ever had.  And he's not much of a foodie.  Server was quick.  A little less chatty than the bartender, but she was efficient.      \n\nI also ordered the Chicken Saltimbocca and he got the Seared tuna.  we were in heaven.   The chicken was in more of a marsala sauce, which I love (and their's was terrificly sauced), but I'm not sure I'd call it saltimbocca.  He thoroughly enjoyed his Tuna.  The mashed potatoes I had were real and full of flavor and the vegetables on the side were a big highlight too.  Freshly cooked carrots and green beans.  We closed out the restaurant.  It was a terrific meal, price was a little high, but definitely worth it.  Our bill came to about $100, but for portion size and what we got?  We were stuffed.  I had to go back to the hotel and take a food nap after.  We also went to the eiffel tower restaurant previously and paid waaaay more for food that was severely under portioned and meh.  I will go back here in a heartbeat.  In fact, maybe every time we go to Vegas.  Bartender highly recommends the porcini crusted ribeye.  Sounded delicious, but we weren't in steak moods.  I will be trying that next time.  :)  Thanks Triple George for a wonderful meal!", "type": "review", "business_id": "OeinO4b26UcICbrLxoj3DQ"}

You will wait in one line to pay then enter another line to get seated....you will wait as every \"VIP and Comp\" gets rushed past you.  The seating process is to have 4 tables taken in at a time by one host....I felt like I should grab the knot on the rope like I was in preschool.  Once seated we explored the expansive buffet.  The choices are great and you need to take a pass without a plate just so you can see what you want...you will never be able to try everything.  The korean ribs and general tao chicken were stand outs for me.  Then is was desert....great selection with an ice cream bar that is unreal...great flavours like peanut butter, chocolate chip, cookie dough and so on....some 12 plus flavours.  It is true that beer and wine are included in the price but don't have high expectations here....I took two glasses of the Merlot and could not choke one down......it burns worse than bar tequila at a Cancun all inclusive.

Though the Paris buffet is arguably just as good from what I remember, I always thought what the Bellagio had to offer was the best overall.  Well, until now that is; move over Bellagio, cuz someone has come along and snatched top billing from you.\n\nNow, don't let the trendy and chic decor distract you...there is some serious food being thrown out here.  While you will might assume it's just the generic sorts of items like salad, Chinese food, sushi, pasta/pizza, and carvery items, there is just so much more to it than that.  Rather, you can find more unique offerings like kalbi (Korean BBQ ribs...surprisingly good!), buns with pork belly, gnocchi, risotto, pork loin, beef stews, flatbreads, truffle potatoes, and even a station to build your own bowl of pho.  Seriously, how many other places can say that?  A pho station!  It'd be better if it were a ramen station, but still impressive enough!\n\nWhat's really cool about the place though is that it's not your usual sort of buffet where you pile a bunch of food on your plate and then go to town.  Rather, like the rest of the hotel, it feels so refined, with a majority of the food being served in small plates, bowls, and mini-pots.  Think like an individual tapas plate buffet.  Pretty ingenious if you ask me since it's probably better at reducing the amount of food that gets wasted or dumped.\n\nThe food alone makes the price worthwhile, but it's even more reasonable when compared to the other buffets on the strip.  Considering the quality and choices, it's not too shabby at $28 a head for lunch (by Vegas buffet standards).  Wicked Spoon has pretty much all you could ask for at a buffet, but I have to admit that the long walk back to the main part of the hotel when you've got a stomach full of food kind of sucks.  In any case, Wicked Spoon is wicked awesome (so cheesy, I know).", "type": "review", "business_id": "zt1TpTuJ6y9n551sw9TaEg"}

It is really nice inside, not claustrophobic like some other big bars in the area, and the music is pretty good. I definitely like that it attracts a nicer classier crowd of people but that is also its downfall. This place is almost so exclusive that if you don't have a table, you wont get in (apparently they cost about $1000 min). I have been lucky enough to know people who do get tables but I cant imagine how it is for people who don't necessarily have that in. The bouncers usually don't tell anyone in line that they are only letting in people with tables and people wait around for hours thinking they are gonna be able to enter the place. I personally would never wait more than 20 minutes to get into anywhere, no place is that worth it. \n\nBiggest disappointment was the drink I ordered from the bar. The bartender didn't know what a Fuzzy Navel was and when I asked her to make me an AMF instead it was undrinkable despite her claiming she knew how to make it. She then just offered me a cup of some kind of sweet and sour juice that didn't help. The poor girl was super sweet, but she just didn't know how to make a drink, maybe she is new and bartending. \n\nHowever I will say that I haven't been to a pool party there yet but I could see how it would be amazing based on the space, and I have heard amazing things. I think this place is probably has a better pool party presence than a nightclub presence just because anyone with tickets can get into the pool parties.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bFStadbRNie-EiHD-XEPMg"}

One of my new favorite hotels to stay at. I had to assure myself that my first Vegas experience would be one to remember...Especially since it was my Birthday weekend with the girls! This hotel had a major part in that. \n   The service was the best! The restaurants were delicious. The pool was unlike any other I've layed by. There were different sections. A calm and relaxing one and the other has a bar w/ a mini casino surrounding it and a dome with a DJ! The rooms were also nice. I especially liked the flat screen in the bathroom and the buttons by the bed to open and close the blinds. The casino was good and the dealers made sure to keep things lively and rolling! (Unfortunately I lost but my friend had some luck!) It tended to be a bit chilly... but what casino isn't kept under 60? lol.\n   Things inside can tend to be pricey. But, that's what you get for staying at the best hotel in Vegas. The age group tends to be a little older, probably because of the higher prices. Some young groups. Many international visitors. The boutique stores downstairs were only the best! Chanel, Dior, Manolo Blahnik, etc.(Not to mention the Ferrari/Maserati dealership attached to the hotel) The only thing that truly made me frustrated was the line to get a taxi. I felt like a child waiting impatiently at Disney World to get on a ride.\n   Besides that EVERYTHING else was great. Classy and unique. The gym was better then the one at the Ritz Clubs and the Spa/Salon was also great with some last minute appointments. Room service was good and prompt.

Through and through and through... although with surprisingly clean floors. In fact, after reading about the Double Down and having knowledge of a drink called \"Ass Juice,\" I was actually surprised at just how clean the Double Down was.

For a mere $20, my friend - if you puke, you are not responsible for cleaning it up. Somehow I don't think this is offered on my AAA policy. \n\nNow, on to the (in)famous drinks. The Double Down falls under my philosophy of \"Just because it's the 'original' doesn't make it the best.\" And that's sadly how I felt about the \"original\" bacon martini.

I got the vanilla with Oreo and marshmallow, it was also really good, the pan is so cold it froze the marshmallow. A little pricey to eat everyday, $16 for two dishes, but for a birthday trip to Vegas it is a great treat. A little hard to find if walking in off the Strip, all the way to the back of Harrah's and upstairs.", "type": "review", "business_id": "NL8XblIxdTvpIO8ogdBLFw"}

There were some weird notes that keep it from being a 5 star rating, the Kome comes with fried potato...which was just french fries thrown into the broth.  I was expecting a potato croquette or something a little more Japanese.  Also, in terms of the greens...I much prefer green onions over spring mix tossed on top.  Soggy salad really doesn't taste too appetizing.  I noticed in the pictures...other people had green onions and not random spring mix.  Perhaps it was the time of day....but I'm willing to give this place another chance and hope it's not quite as odd the 2nd time around.  However, the noodles here are my favorite out of all the ramen locations.  They are thick and chewy and cooked al dente.  The chashu I wish was a little more flavorful, but it was a good ratio of meat to fat.  The Mame was my favorite since it came with a legit shrimp tempura and the broth seemed richer in flavor than the Kome.  We also tried the karaage, but it seemed a little oily and the coating wasn't as crispy as I like.  They do end the meal on a very good note, we were given free yuzu sorbet.

Whaaaat!! I'm a Boston gal who knows her seafood. Never in my life have I seen someone charge that amount. Nevermind that the menu says they are $2.50 but they all of a sudden claimed it was a premium oyster at a different price.\n\nI can forgive mishaps and mistakes - it happens to the best of us.

It may take a little while to get what you ordered, but that's okay because the fruit smoothies and acai bowls are worth the wait! My mango-banana smoothie wasn't made from a flavored powder mix and it wasn't watered down, either. It actually tasted like the fruits I ordered for my smoothie, and that's what I like most about this place -- they give us what Mother Nature intended fruits to taste like. \n\nOn a separate occasion, I ordered myself an acai bowl to hold off my midday snack cravings. I ordered the traditional acai bowl, and asked them if they could add mango (upcharge of 99\u00a2), and they gladly accommodated!\n\nThe apple juice as a base gave it more of a tart flavor, but it was balanced well with the sweetness of the fruits and honey. The coconut shavings and the crunchy granola gave it a good texture. Overall, their acai bowls are really refreshing and are the perfect thing to snack on when you have down time. I'm not an acai bowl aficionado but from my own judgment, the acai bowl I got here was great!\n\nThere's not much going on in the shopping plaza it's located in, but it's definitely worth a try for those fresh fruit fanatics.", "type": "review", "business_id": "iR535TnJtX9aC5mp6vYprw"}

I just came in for an x ray because my wisdom teeth were coming in.  I figured it was going to be a easy visit but then they talked me into extracting a tooth by saying it would only cost $93, I don't know there are complications so that will be $165. I figure what the hell I'm already here I already waited might as well go through with it... Bad idea. \nKeep in mind these are dental students not actual dentists, so they really are not that experienced especially when it came to the student that I had. So here's how it goes novacane my gums and go to town on my tooth for 45 minutes. The kid had to stop 3 times to take a breather and shake his arm out because it was getting tired , his assistant kept giving him looks like what are you doing man.  He kept, how do I put this, wiggling his clamps on my tooth to the point where they were clanging around my other teeth for 45 minutes, any kept losing grip of his tools as well. After all that misery the kid asks another student for help, she is literally in there for 2 minutes and my tooth is finally out thank god.  As it turned out that this procedure was a competency test for that student and the girl that helped him told him that he should say that he did not receive any help... so basically the kid cheated. So now its over and I go to pay and the kid tells me that oh yeah I forgot to tell you there is a consulting fee as well so that'll be another $40...fuck me so basically and $93 tooth extraction turns into a $200 tooth distraction plus $40 for the x ray. On top of that the painkillers I got were not strong enough I have to take double doses and  now I'm out of them\nThe moral of the story is go to a real dentist if you are planning something like getting your wisdom teeth taken out", "type": "review", "business_id": "hJqXtb1z2rE9uxV_5iGENg"}

I reserved a room at the Flamingo thru Expedia for Mon Nov 18th.  I arrived around 11pm in my car, and had 2 large suitcases with me.  I needed to valet my car and receive bell service for my luggage.  Well, I received neither since the valet parking lane was jammed with cars that appeared to be parked there permanently, and there was no valet in sight.  Hmmm.  No bell captain either, so I end up parking in the garage and lugging my stuff to the not-so-close reception desk. \n\nAnd there waiting for me was a really long check-in line.  I tried to avoid the line by using a kiosk to check in (nobody else was using them, btw) but it only offered \"non-smoking\" rooms.  This was unacceptable to me because I am a heavy smoker and offer no apologies for my personal habits.  (I also pay a zillion percent in tobacco and \"sin taxes\" too, so next time you see a smoker give him/her a big ole smooch because YOUR taxes and cost of living would be higher without the zillions of dollars us smokers pay in taxes each year.  Remember that.)\n\nMoving On: with no luck at the kiosk, I'm back in that dreadful looking line.  And it was every bit as painful as it looked.  Worse yet, there was a separate VIP line for next-in-line service for their VIP players, which made us poor wretches feel evern more miserable watching high-faluting people take cuts in front of us.  Simply stated, the line sucked out any joy and happiness from us new arrivers and made us all quite miserable.  After FORTY FIVE minutes of this pain and suffering, I finally make it to the desk, only to be informed that their entire tower which offers smoking rooms was being closed for renovation and they had NO smoking rooms available of any kind.   W-o-W.  Seriously?  I then advised the clerk that I needed either A). a smoking room or B). the manager because I was cancelling my reservation.  \n\nLet's Be Fair Here;  the manager was calm, cool and collected and assured me that they were cancelling my reservation with a full refund for being unable to accommodate my needs.  My call to Expedia 10 minutes later confirmed that and I have since received a full refund.  So at least I didn't get jerked around on my refund. \n\nBUT I had a simply miserable experience at the Flamingo -- and worst of all, as I'm driving away it's midnight in Vegas and I didn't have a reservation anywhere (look out, Motel 6!).  Instead, I had an Expedia app which steered me towards the Gold Coast and my experiece at the GC was a complete 180 and they totally saved my night.  Feel free to read my review on that experience as well.  As for the Flamingo.....NEVER again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "NGJDjdiDJHmN2xxU7KauuA"}

I love tapas and the menu looked so promising...carpaccio with truffle oil, grilled octopus with a red wine reduction, and chorizo clams in a white wine broth.  My mouth waters just thinking about these dishes and many more on Barcelona's menu, but I'm sad to report that this was one of the most disappointing restaurants I've ever been to!\n\nIt just so happens that I recently acquired a coupon to this restaurant and went to it last Friday.  I just want to make it clear that I would have happily tried this place at full price, and the dish I was looking most forward to trying was the carpaccio (you just can't go wrong with raw beef and truffle oil...I'd hope).  My boyfriend and I were seated and greeted promptly.  When the server came over to take our drink order, he looked down at my coupon, took it and went straight to the kitchen.  Being a server for a long time, I could tell he was not happy that we brought this coupon, but I tried to remedy the situation by being extremely nice.  We ordered the carpaccio, pan fried dates, steamed clams, diabla shrimp, grilled octopus, saut\u00e9ed tilapia, albondigas, and merguez.  After a short while the tapas started coming out, and after delivering the first wave, our server said, \"I'm sorry, but the carpaccio is very popular and we are running out of it tonight.\"  I smiled and said disappointed, \"oh really?\" and he responded, \"yes.\"  Both my boyfriend and I picked up on his wording, but we did not confront him about it.  It is my strong belief that they had enough carpaccio for AT LEAST another order, but they didn't want to waste it on a table with a coupon!  As the night progressed our server grew increasingly more impatient and annoyed with our presence.  When we got our check he had manually written in an 18% tip...on a table for 2, and I always automatically tip 20% (even when the service is bad)!  With a coupon or something comped, I usually tip much more because that's what fellow service industry workers do...(can you tell how livid I am?)  Unfortunately, I wish I could say that only the service was sub par, but the food ranged from ok to not even edible.\n\nPan Fried Dates- This was the best dish we had from Barcelona.  The bacon was cooked well, all of the textures were spot on, and they had a nice savory sweet taste.  However, the red wine reduction was way too thin, the blue cheese crumbles were on the stingy side, and Firefly's are much better.\n\nSteamed Clams- The clams were cooked well, but the chorizo was very dry.  The broth also needed more seasoning (this is a common theme).\n\nDiabla Shrimp- I liked this, but again, it was not as good as Firefly's.  A nice spicy sweet sauce with shrimp, but the sauce was a little too thin.\n\nGrilled Octopus- This just lacked seasoning.  The octopus was a pretty good texture, not too chewy, but the flavor was bland.  For good grilled octopus, try Olives in the Bellagio.\n\nSauteed Tilapia- Completely inedible!  I'm not sure if the kitchen just didn't care or if they genuinely made a mistake, but the outside of the fish was mushy and the inside was raw.  I've never seen fish this texture before, and I honestly can't think of how it happened.\n\nAlbondigas- Meatballs in marinara with melted mozzarella on top.  These were so dry we drenched each bite in the marinara.\n\nMerguez- A spicy lamb sausage served over roasted red pepper couscous.  The sausage was dry and not very spicy.  The couscous was a little wet, but it had a good flavor.\n\nThe one good thing about our experience was that the man refilling our drinks was extremely friendly!  He never let a drink go empty and explained they have live music some nights.  I really wish the food had been better so I could give this place a second chance.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3AMFoTdFm7j2bocSpm7Xxw"}

First planned stop was American Fish for happy hour but... closed!  Second planned stop was Sage and... closed!  Bar Masa also closed! Dammit!\n\nWe started to lose faith and I nonchalantly suggested Social House in Crystals because we had never been there.  If the menu didn't appeal, at least we could have a Sapporo at the bar and re-think our strategy.  \n\nI was expecting something akin to Kona Grill... typical sushi but nothing to write home about.  I was so wrong.  We walked in and sat at the bar.  The friendly bartender gave us menus and we discovered that they actually have pretty decent cocktails!\n\nI had the Socialite ($14) which is spiced rum, passion fruit juice, orange juice, and serrano chili.  I didn't really taste the chili, but it was all good because it was yummy!\n\nMy husband had the Cachaca Espuma ($16) which is cachaca (fermented sugar cane), lime, green tea, and a vanilla/coconut foam (referred to as espuma).  The bartender grated a little lime peel on top.  I'm not a big fan of coconut and the smell was pretty strong but my husband made a dent in the foam so I could try the drink below without gagging and it was pretty good!\n\nFor food, we tried the yellowtail with crispy jalapeno, garlic dust, tiny cilantro (just like the microchives that used to be on everything a few years back), and calamansi soy ($22).  I think calamansi is a type of citrus fruit but I didn't ask.  This is excellent!  The crispy jalapeno adds good texture and is different than just having fresh or pickled jalapeno tossed on top.  And the garlic dust!  Everything should be covered in garlic dust!  Awesome idea!\n\nWe also tried the crispy pata which is a crackling pork shank with pickled carrots and garlic served with a chili vinegar on the side ($24).  The vinegar is very strong, and they warned us of that, so you only dip the pork in a little bit.  The pork shank has both crispy skin and tender meat.  Also the bones have some tasty bone marrow inside so get a chopstick and fish it out!  Yummy dish!\n\nThese are smallish portions but high quality food... perfect for a foodie crawl.  The bartender and servers are willing to spend time talking to you about your likes and dislikes and develop a tasting menu on the fly for you, which is pretty cool!  Definitely coming back here for a full meal to try that!", "type": "review", "business_id": "uqisw8IXD5ZutU4MT2MQVw"}

She brought a food back with her and gave it to me with no bag or silverware. We asked them to call a cab for us and she said: please wait outside for your cab. This is in Las Vegas! In the heat!

This should not be the case. \n\nPavle was so kind and took the dessert of my tab.

I would visit frequently for chocolate chip cookies, tarlets and the occasional birthday cake. Everything was so delicious. I've been to the new location a few times and it seems like they have lost their touch. Maybe the coziness of the former location added to the charm?\n\nOn my first trip to the new location, my husband and I had breakfast. I ordered a breakfast sandwich which was served on Layer's version of a croissant. I must say it was one of the oddest combinations. The croissant was not tradionally fluffy, but was overly greasy and so flaky that it fell apart and left my fingers dripping of oil. I could not even cut it with a knife, it just made an even bigger mess. After a few bites, I started to think my taste buds were off because the flavors just did not jive. When my husband tried it - he agreed. We realized that sandwich had a horseradish-like spread... yuck! He also was not impressed by his breakfast quiche. I find it a bit arrogant that there was a comment made by Layers management that their flavor combinations should not be questionned... maybe they should listen to customers!\n\nThe other issue I have is bussing your own dishes is awkward and inconvenient, especially when we spent over $20 on breakfast. TIP for Management: since the place isn't that big, and the food prices are moderately high - maybe you should bus the dishes.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zBacxYJdcxmJETelXMt9aw"}

I ordered a few rolls that the waitress suggested and gyoza for dessert. The gyoza was in fact delicious, the best thing we ordered that night. The sushi and rolls however were mediocre, and the fish did not taste fresh. The presentation was nothing special, it did not even compel me to take a picture of it.  Not to exaggerate, but I've had better tasting and more beautifully presented sushi at local sushi places or even AYCE.

We went against our better judgment upon reviews when we moved in, almost two years ago. Bad reviews, horrible service, etc. Well, if the shoe fits...they were awful. Alliance properties is a mess and very dishonest and not caring. The management staff turned over quicker than a fast food joint. I think I met at least 3-4 different property managers while I was there, and who knows how many I didn't meet. \n\nUpon move-in, they didn't have our fabs or storage key ready. In fact they didn't seem to remember we signed up for a storage unit. They got us a key. It was a second floor unit, which was wrong. We eventually got it right, on a first floor. \n\nThe \"phantom charges\" in previous posts are 100% true. A \"mandatory\" $25 for some stupid trash service. I'm a 30 ear old guy. I can take my own trash out. What a waste of $25 that I tried to refute but was unable to. The \"community fees\" for gas and electricity and water for community areas is bogus. I've lived in many apartments and never heard of these fees. Isn't that what RENT is for? They never mentioned ANY of these fees upon walk through. In the summer time my rent was close to $100 more because of these fees; NOT BUDGETED. Meaning we were basically, dishonestly robbed of $100 that I didn't have and couldn't get out of it. They certainly didn't care the least that people were troubled by this. We were even threatened with a $50 fee for leaving the \"mandatory\" trash bin outside our apartment all day. Sorry San Cierra, like I wasn't busy at all during the day. I heard many people talking to the managers about these and they simply said they couldn't do anything. Get a clue Alliance. \n\n\"Luxury Apartment\"? Right. The front gate was broke and permanently open for the first 5-6 months we lived there. At NO TIME, did any of the main pools gates all work at the same time. One was always chained off or broken. The Six gas grills around the main pool; only 1 igniter worked and maybe 2 that were \"clean\" enough to cook on. Half of them were so caked with poor maintenance and bad apartment dwellers that the heat didn't even rise to the food.\n\nAfter our first year, literally because we were in a job transition and didn't want to move, we renewed. The management came back a few weeks later with a new renewal notice saying we had to tell them if we were moving or not and had passed the 60 days. Somehow between the corporate Alliance and the main office of the apartment, no communication and they finally \"found\" my renewal. I almost wanted to say screw it and leave, but just couldn't unfortunately. \n\nEven when moving out, no one had a clue. I emailed them through their own Alliance website and payment page, and it never made it to the main office, so again, they thought we weren't responding about our 60 notice. Then we were told we had to give a date of move out, then we were told we didn't. Literally between the constant new staff, no one had a clue about anything in that office.\n\nEven locationally, this place is terrible. A fatal shooting at the Walmart down the road, multiple robberies and break-ins through the neighboring houses and apartments. Cops constantly around or in the apartments looking for people. It's a shady area with shady people and is no way luxury.\n\nLong story short, horrible service, horrible company, horrible apartments, horrible people living in the apartments, in no way shape or form luxury, dishonest, too high of turnover in management and staff and no care. How can a company flat out not care about it's people? Don't ever consider moving here.", "type": "review", "business_id": "IRiFdzRDzXxy_6cLB5cbXA"}

I figured the egg rolls had to be bomb because it is very difficult to mess up vietnamese egg rolls. My mistake for assuming... within the first bite I was immediately disappointed. They were burnt, chewey, and had a very distinct funny smell. Maybe they had gone bad already? I had my bf taste them and he was disgusted by them as well. Without a doubt the worst egg rolls I have ever eaten. I ended up throwing away two orders of egg rolls within only taking two bites. The pho was mediocre and tasted like it had an overpowering aroma of cinnamon in it? What the pho?!?!! \nAfter finishing her vietnamese version of American idol, the hostess/owner?/singer gave the Mic to another employee to sing... but as she walked back to her hostess stand and grabbed her bottle of Hennessey and proceeded to drink while giving me a dirty stare.

This place tries to be a jack of all trades, Chinese and Japanese alike, but is a master of none. I have tried a wide variety of items on the menu, and none of them really jump out at me. The last time I was there I had an orange chicken dish, and it lacked flavor and was difficult to chew. However, most of the soups I have tried are good. \n\nIf you want Chinese food, go to Grand China. If you want Japanese food, go to Geisha House. This place is a red-headed step-child of an Asian restaurant that can't decide which way it wants to go.", "type": "review", "business_id": "C4CbD-0Rz4nglavf_0dRdg"}

A little too spicy and raw for my date, but I loved it. After that, it took what seemed like forever for our food to arrive. My date loved the sweet potato gnocchi. My steak was cooked to the correct doneness, but per the usual for steakhouses, needed more salt. This, and I had no idea what it was that accompanied my steak. Server was nowhere to be found. I finally flag him down and he explains what was on my plate, but I'm not sure what this was. HAHA... I asked him for salt, but it never came. After 15 minutes or so, I flagged down the busser who hooked it up. \n\nWe finally got the bill and got our food wrapped up. Place was incredibly overpriced for the service and quality of food is not worth it. Its the same price as Bouchon, so I would recommend anyone in Vegas to go there instead. \n\nOh, all this AND they double charged me.

How this girl retains this job when she is so miserable to people, doesn't smile, doesn't say thank you - is beyond me.\nI let their head office know.  They care.  I was promptly emailed back and asked for more details.  I was told they want to fix the problem.  I suppose it takes a while to weed out bad employees.  I have no idea how long this girl worked there but, I am glad they plan on fixing the problem.", "type": "review", "business_id": "VsgXwpFdqbUaYP5PCQzeoQ"}

We arrived at the restaurant at 6:45pm. I had called ahead and asked about the wait time for 2 and I was informed that the wait was about 35 minutes. We were okay with that. When we got to the restaurant the wait had increased to 45 minutes which was whatever, I understand that they are busy and they are the new kid on the block. Right away we after sitting in the waiting area we witnessed a rather unpleasant scene unfold. A very unhappy gentleman was at the hostess stand yelling that he had been waiting for 2 hours. Now this is rather ridiculous and if he and his party had been waiting that long, they should have approached the stand earlier or just left, there is no need to wait that long to be seated in a restaurant, I guarantee the food here is not worth a 2 hour wait. They GM came over to the stand and told the man that they would get him seated immediately. He did follow the GM to the table but he was clearly very angry. After that, we witnessed about 3 other guests come up to the stand and say they had been waiting well over 45 minutes. They were all seated right away. The manager came back to the hostess stand and yelled at all of the girls (3 of them) working on the seating chart. It was very unprofessional and he should have done this at a different time in a different setting. Clearly, all they needed at that point was help. Poor management. This whole seating debacle seemed to set everything back and we didn't end up being seated until 7:45pm. \n\nOnce seated we were greeted quickly by our waitress. She was nice and got us water right away. Unfortunately after she got us water, we only saw her about once every 15-20 minutes. First my fiance ordered a starter salad. We received this about 20 minutes after being seated. We usually share the salad so we asked for an additional plate, never got it. It had hardly any ranch on it so we asked for an extra side of ranch, we never got it. We ordered our entrees when our salad came out, I ordered the ribs with mac and cheese and cole slaw, my fiance ordered the chicken fingers 50/50 with half buffalo and half original and fries. It took another 30 minutes for the food to arrive. We saw many other tables around us, who had been seated after us receive their food before we did. I do have to say that the ribs were good, not the best I have ever had but they were tasty. The mac and cheese was really good. The problem was with my fiance's meal. First of all, the half buffalo, half original was a joke. I thought based on pictures that had been posted that the buffalo strips came out similar to a buffalo wing. Wrong. Instead they just shook some buffalo sauce over the top of the strips which coated parts of all of the chicken strips making them all buffalo, not 50/50. It also made them extremely soggy and the breading just fell apart, not very appetizing. When the chicken strips came out he had asked for barbecue sauce right away. We waited and waited and never saw our waitress. No barbecue sauce to be found. Sometimes you really need a sauce to be able to eat a meal, this was one of those cases. My fiance never received his sauce and was very unhappy about the entire meal. Service was horrible. It was non existent really. I can only imagine that based on the way that the GM was talking to the hostess staff that it also carried over to the wait staff which in turn, I'm sure makes for a very stressful environment especially for new staff. It was 9:15pm when we left the restaurant.\n\nOverall my assessment is that Cheddar's has a long way to go to become a smooth running restaurant. They need to work out some kinks in both customer service and the kitchen in order to improve the experience for their guests. They just simply don't know how to handle how busy the restaurant currently is and this is not making a good impression for a new restaurant. It will be a long time before I visit Cheddar's again. The food is pretty good but not worth an hour wait and poor customer service.", "type": "review", "business_id": "oly8HWl0MtuioFWKPINIFg"}

Had a reservation for 6:30 and was seated within a couple of minutes. Things got kinda mixed once at the table. Our server was prompt, attentive, and very nice, but never introduce herself (I feel like that should be standard). \n\nOrdered water and a Woodford (neat) and both were prompt to the table, but the water is bottled and they charge for it. I feel like if that's the case, the option for tap at no charge should be offered. Throughout the meal we had to continue to ask for standard things, like plates.\n\nFOOD -\n\nConsidering this the first time here for either of us, we ordered a number of things to try.One word can describe 95% of the meal... DRY!\n\nWe opened with the Cream Corn Fritters and they were prompt to the table. They were crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Very tasty and, unfortunately, the high point of the meal. Also, I think there may have been problems in the kitchen that night. It was over 40 mins between our appetizer and the entrees. I don't think our problem was isolated, because I didn't see any food coming out of the kitchen for the tables near us either.\n\nFor entrees, we had both the Memphis-Style Dry Rubbed Spareribs and the Mopped Baby Back Ribs. The ribs are huge and very meaty. However, there is no discernible difference between their dry rib and the mopped rib, which should be considered \"wet\".  Flavor was good, but both ribs were no where close to juicy and were very dry.\n\nWe also had the Smoked Chicken and the Texas-Style Beef Brisket. The menu says an order is \"1/2 smoked chicken\" which should be 4 pieces, but it's really 1/4 of a chicken since you get 2 pieces of chicken. The chicken pieces were small relative to the ribs, though they tasted good. The Beef Brisket was by far the biggest disappointment. The brisket had very little bark and no smoke ring. It was cut very thin and was dry as doctor's cotton. Literally, would suck every ounce of moisture out of my mouth.\n\nFor sides, we had the Hoppin John (DRY), Kale and Cashew Slaw, Mac and Cheese, Fries with Alabama Sauce, and the Cornbread with Honey Butter (DRY). They were okay, but neither of us ate more than a 2-3 bites of each.\n\nATMOSPHERE -\n\nIt's a casual and fun atmosphere for sure, very welcoming. We sat at a booth, which was HUGE and there seemed to be plenty of space between us and other guests. Nice place for a casual date before the movies or a night with family. I really liked the overall design and layout of the restaurant and could see it being fun for big groups of 6+. \n\nPlenty of TV's in the bar area, but not blasting noise all over the place. Background music was the same, loud enough to create atmosphere but you can still speak with your other guests.\n\nOVERALL -\n\nIt was an okay experience, but I won't be rushing back for a \"second chance\" anytime soon. \"Meh. I've experienced better\" is an appropriate rating for Pot Liquor CAS. That's EXACTLY how I felt throughout the meal. Pricing level is okay overall, but not a bargain by any definition IMHO.", "type": "review", "business_id": "H3SaoIWnlG-HvGQ8v6J6yg"}

I walked out in the middle of my appointment....And I am not a difficult customer or patient...But when it becomes apparent that you can't trust someone with your unborn baby's health - that is when you have to walk away.\n\nFirst girl asked if I felt fetal movement yet and when I told her \"no\" she seemed perplexed and said \"really, you haven't felt anything?\"  (I am at 11 weeks - fetal movement doesn't happen until 16-25 weeks.) Had this not been my 3rd child and I had not known better I would have been worried something was wrong with my baby by her reaction and questioning.\n\nAfter being weighed and blood pressure taken, they were going to give me a genetics testing kit and send me on my way. One lady said I had to go to a lab for blood work. the other stated someone would be in shortly to take my blood - they went back and forth on whether I would get my blood taken there or at a lab. (It ended up them telling me I had to go to a lab because the lady who does the Phlebotomy was out). So, as they tried to scurry me off, I asked why I wasn't getting an internal exam like I was told they were going to do at my previous appointment? (That was the whole reason I was there as I could have picked up the genetic kit at any time.)\n\nI was told that nothing was in their notes from my prior appointment that I was to have an exam - but told me to get undressed and someone would be in shortly. After she walked out I noticed there was no gown - I had to go in the hallway to find someone and they said they didn't have any gowns - she found a thin paper bib for me to place over myself....\n\nSo, as I sit there naked, another lady comes in and tells me I don't need an exam and acts like I was mistaken for thinking that I would need one -(but my husband was a witness as he was also there at my previous appointment when the lady told me I was to have one.) So she said  she would give me an exam if \"I INSISTED\"...I replied,  \"Who in their right mind would want to get probbed if they didn't have to? I am sitting here naked because I was told I needed one. If I don't then you just made my day\"...But then I asked about listening to the heart beat or getting my uterus felt for progression, or to check my cervix - (the usual things - this is my 3rd child so I know what to expect by now.) she tells me \"We usually do that at your 4 week follow up appointment.\" I replied,\"This IS my 4 week follow up appointment - why else was I sceduled to come here?.\" Literally, all they did was weigh me and check my blood pressure.\n\nShe tried to back peddle after that but it was too late. Too many fails. She told me to wait for the nurse to come in and set up my next appointment when she would give me the full check up. That is when I got dressed and walked out. \n\nI previously had a miscarriage and the doctor I spoke to at my prior appointment knew this and that is why it was important to monitor the growth of my baby as I am also going to be 40 years old...\n\nThere are just TOO many people and you don't see the same person more than once and there is no communication.

You would think when someone spends $32,000 on a new car, that they should be getting everything correct and up to date.\n\nThe other incident happened this spring when I sent a referral in to purchase a used car. This person had decent credit, and a half down payment for the car, only to be given a long, drawn out hassle in the process. She was sent rejection letters, after she had been approved, telling her she had to bring the car back... the papers had already been signed, and she was given an approval from the loan company. \n\nThere seriously needs to be some shake-up there with the staff. All the other Honda dealerships I've purchased from have been honest with me about things, and I've always had a brand loyalty to the company. I know I'll never come back to this one for anything more than basic maintenance.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KnN9v8-4FpGEguQaibWjSg"}

I've traveled throughout Asia on more than one occassion, taught English in China and spent years seeking out authentic eateries in the Asian-based areas of this country's biggest Metropolitan cities. Thai food holds a special place in my heart, but never have I been as disappointed as I was with my experience at Papaya Thai!\n\nIf Papaya Thai was worth the words, I would gladly go into more detail about the atmosphere, the menu and the quality-to-value ratio, as I do with my other reviews... \n\nHowever, there's really not much to say about this dark and dirty hole-in-the-wall next to the Dollar Store. The service isn't worth the price of tipping, the food is as hit-and-miss as it gets and the owner couldn't care less if he loses a customer, which, judging by the fact that not a single person came in during the entire 45 minutes I was there on a Tuesday during prime mealtime, is something he must excel at! \n\nFor the record, I haven't sent a food item back due to an issue in over 4 years. Unfortunately, Papaya Thai effectively ruined that streak for me...and on their signature \"Pad Thai\" noodle dish, nonetheless! \n\nThe sad part is that what I got in return, besides a table-side confrontation from a rude, know-it-all cook (who told me I could not order the Pad Thai there anymore!), was even worse!!!\n\nSimply put, I won't be back. If the food was even half-decent, I would have gladly chocked the experience up to an unfortunate coincidence and happily given it another shot. However, only 1 of the 3 entrees we tried (a chicken curry dish) was even edible and the prices they demand are among the highest of all such restaurants in the area! \n\nThere are many, much better places in the area to spend your hard earned cash at if you crave the taste of Thai food! \n\nAvoid Papaya Thai!", "type": "review", "business_id": "DjxX8St0I4bFVdrP09CdTA"}

The same website we found their hours, all listed accordingly. But, we were sadly mistaken when we as arrived to their location. The door was locked and unlike the hours stated online, it had said that we're closed on Tuesdays. Tuesday's? Really? Such a random and pointless day!

As the day went on I depleted my cash so when asked for a $5 cover I requested that I could just add it to the bar tab...  Not a problem, the doorman brought my card to the bar and started a tab with $15 as there were three of us.  We ended up getting a table so started a tab with our waitress.  We ordered a bottle and a cocktail.  The cocktail came but no bottle as we waited for quite some time.  In this time one of our group decided they couldn't wait any longer.  I had to go find my waitress to request that we cancel the bottle and order a single glass as the one would not be drinking an entire bottle (the attempt to bring us our bottle had never ever begun).  After waiting more time and the glass never being delivered we closed out our tab with the waitress and I went to the bar to close the tab for the cover charge.  The tab at the bar was not for any service merely the cover charge so I did not feel the need to tip on the balance.  However seeing the charges on my card I noticed that Kazimierz took the liberty of giving themselves a 40% tip on the cover charges!!!!!  This is ridiculous!  Not only did I receive service so poor we decided to leave,  pay a cover charge for it, but they also decided to commit fraud by writing in their own 40% tip on the cover charges.  Well played Kazimierz!!!  You Suck!!!  It's not the money it's the principal.  You may want to have a chat with your staff.  The waitress was one of the worst I've had and it's not too hard to bring drinks...  Unless she stepped behind the bar to grab the receipt and write in another tip there's someone shady behind the bar.  I'm just guessing this isn't the first time something like this has happened.

We ended up waiting another HOUR for our bay...absolutely ridiculous. \n\nThe staff at the concierge service seemed to be high schoolers without ANY training in basic customer service. Even went as far to say \"yeah, you're not the only one to complain.\" I asked for a manager, and no one could be found. The food, drinks and games were great, as usual. However, the obvious lack of customer services training, under staffing of phone lines, and grossly inaccurate wait times left me with a bad taste in my mouth. \n\nTo the managers at Top Golf, PLEASE train your staff on customer service etiquette, and figure out a way to accurately give out wait times.

Clearly Prime's reputation is strong enough from a perception standpoint to bring clients in, and the stuffy 'dress code' is there to enhance the \"exclusivity\" if you will. All the while the service is worse than the worst McDonalds restaurant. What a joke.\n\nWe finally connected with one of the hourly employees at the front counter and they proceeded to try to negotiate with me about wether we had actually requested an outside table or not. It was the equivalent of a conversation with a night club promoter about what it would take to get he table you want. Happy Anniversary I guess... \n\nThe good news is we went to the bar where a very friendly, competent and quality old school bartender provided real service. We ordered a glass of champagne, settled the check and informed person number 6 that I had to interact with that we would be going elsewhere.\n\nThey quickly back peddled, all of a sudden a front row table outside was available.\n\nI politely informed them that we would be going elsewhere.\n\nThe four employees were huddling around with the real manager and watching to see what we would do. I doubt they expected that I would take the time to share the truth about the experience on line.\n\nLook, here is the bottom line. When you are heading out to an expensive dinner, especially for an important event, and preparing to spend a considerable amount of money, you deserve the absolute best service and mentality. There's no entitlement here. Just because your restaurant is overlooking the Bellagio fountains doesn't mean it's automatically any better than a revolving restaurant exploiting its view to sell you overpriced food.\n\nThe restaurant is down stairs from the Bellagio Esplanade, it's a stuffy, dark, cave like environment with a very heavy small of cooked and worked over food. Think senior retirement center cafe with expensive decor.\n\nIf you want my advice, there are a dozen steak houses in town, all much better in every way. I would recommend the SW at Wynn or Carnevino at Pallazo. Of course I can't speak to the food since I couldn't stand the mentality. I can only tell you about the smell and the attitude. Both stink.\n\nTry the bar I guess then high tail it out of there before they take your cash and feed the snob beast.\n\nBetter luck elsewhere.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Bt7lGzIlPGc13iCXoc-TIw"}

I went in on 10/8/2012 for a late lunch. The crew is so disappointed to see anyone outside of rush hour. It is the most unwelcoming feeling. I could not sit down because of the filthy seat. My husband had to find something to wipe down my booth seat before I could sit down. The busser didn't even seem to notice that there was dirty seats at every table he cleaned. The floor under one table was absolutely filthy. No one blinked an eye. The manager stood and stared out to the floor. He was far enough away to not see anything. Bad strategy. The server completely abandoned us after our food came. She brought me a ketchup with nothing in it and then proceeded to stand at another table and talk for five minutes. My husband had to go get some pico and tabasco for us. We finally interrupted her to get another bottle of ketchup.\n\nI did not like my meal at all. It fell apart. It was dry. They put about a 1/4 teaspoon of hummus on it. It was a black bean burger that desperately needed salt. I had no opportunity to ask for anything to improve it because the server failed to check on us for eternity. My hubby loved his hummus and chicken dish and the caramelized cauliflower/tahini dish was out of this world delicious. That got them an additional star.\n\nThis store has completely neglected the details. Their standards have taken a serious dive. I will not be going back until they have new management in place.

(And that's being generous.)  \n\nCame in tonight (Sunday) around 8:30pm; less than half empty.  Took over ten minutes just to get greeted.  We ordered:\n\nAppetizer:  Egg Rolls.  Which came out extremely overcooked.  I asked the server if they had soy sauce since most places already have it on the table, and she said \"yes\", and just stared at me blankly.  I said \"well, can I have some please?\".  She left and eventually came back with it about 5 minutes later.\n\nBoyfriend:  Steak Pho, which he said tasted pretty bland.\n\nMe:  Vegetable Pho with extra veggies.  Broth was very sweet, and pretty gross.  I tried adding soy sauce, jalepenos, pepper, anything and everything to make it edible; which didn't help.  The only veggies that were in the soup were baby corn, cauliflower, broccoli, carrots, and mushrooms.  Cauliflower? Really?  No bok choy, no cabbage.. Needless to say was VERY disappointed.  Being a vegetarian and having eaten at countless pho places, I was sorry I even ordered it.\n\nDaughter:  Kid's Meal chicken nuggets and fries.  She had no complaints, but then again, she eats my cooking.  Not very easy to mess that up.\n\nService:  Polite at first.  Gentleman that took our order and delivered our entrees was nice.  Orders were correct.  Then, he disappeared and we had no service whatsoever throughout our entire meal.  We were finished eating and were waiting to ask for a container and the check for over 15 minutes.  A young lady appeared and asked the table next to us (that came in after us) if they needed anything, as they were just finishing up.  They asked for a container, and the lady took her soup to box it up, and didn't even look our way.  Not sure how she missed us, because we were basically sitting right on top of them.  5 minutes later she brings them their box and check and walks away.  My boyfriend literally had to yell \"excuse me\" to get her to even acknowledge our existence.  We asked for a container and the check, which she brought relatively promptly.  AND THEN... we get to the cashier and she THEN informs us that it's \"cash only\".  I thought my boyfriend's head was going to spin around at that point.  SERIOUSLY??!  Who, in this day and age, doesn't accept cards of any kind?? While my boyfriend was at the ATM, I, at least, looked around for any signs stating that it is cash only.  ONE. One tiny, single sign stuck at the bottom of the window to the kitchen.  That's it.  So, you know, just in case the kitchen workers forget they can't use their card..  Fortunately, my boyfriend doesn't have to pay any ATM fees, due to his military debit card.  Had we had to pay a fee, though, there would have been a problem.  That is it for the rating part, but just in case you are enjoying my rant, below I will tell you about the farm animals sitting all around us...\n\nTables are very close together, and a couple was seated at the table next to us at a table for 4, and the server purposely put the menus on the opposite end of their table, so as to give us room.  Nope.  They move over right next to us, pretty much sitting in our laps.  As we wait for our food, chick next me starts playing videos on her phone at FULL VOLUME, so loud that we can't carry on a conversation.  Didn't help that the music was blaring in the restaurant, also.  Then, a group of 5 adults, one child, probably 4 years old, get seated behind us.  They all start hugging in the aisle like they've not seen each other in decades, and just continue to stand there talking while the kid runs all over the place.  Keep in mind, the restaurant is very small.  They finally sit down and are talking so loud and making so much noise, you would have thought they were at home in their own dining room.  All the while, they are completely ignoring the kid as she takes out ALL of the chopsticks (not wrapped, they were plastic) and plays with them, before putting them back again.  Gross.  Table next to us gets their food, and the chick next to me is slurping her soup louder than any CHILD EVER would.  It was ridiculous.  I seriously began to think that I was On a hidden camera show, or Punk'd, or something.  All around, a very painful visit from beginning to end.

We opted for the latter. The restaurant couldn't control the weather, but some misters out there would be nice.\n\nThe waiter took some time to get to us, which was particularly odd since there were only a couple tables seated outside. We ordered water and he had to come by twice to say our drinks were on the way... -_-\n\nWe passed on any appetizers as we found that section to be a little lacking. Actually, I expected more from the entire menu.\n\nI ordered the Cajun chicken sandwich and my fianc\u00e9 ordered the signature mac and cheese bacon burger. We both finished our waters and didn't have a refill until after our food arrived. \n\nMy Cajun sandwich tasted like the chicken had been pre cooked and then reheated with the vegetables and seasonings separately. The cheese was melted into the roll and then the filling placed on top. When it arrived, the cheese had hardened again-as if it had been waiting under a heat lamp for some time after being cooked. I asked for a side if ranch, and wouldn't you know...I finished half my food before it arrived.\n\nThe \"signature\" burger wasn't all that much better. First, they need to use a different bun. It fell apart immediately. The burger itself was dry, overlooked, and under seasoned. I think they hoped all the other toppings would mask that. Unfortunately, the Mac and cheese was bland. The blue box at home would have left this stuff in the dust. The bacon was carelessly placed and hanging off the side  when it came.\n\nI will say the fries were good. A combination of curly, shoestring, crinkle cut, and waffle fries with some BBQ cheddar kind of seasoning.\n\nIt seemed like everything on the menu was $20. We passed on the disappointment of ordering a desert and chalked this experience up to something we could say we've done. :/", "type": "review", "business_id": "ateowLnq6kpgNNWHzCDByQ"}

That left a very sour taste in my mouth. I had gone one other time as well and was hit with the $5 cover again. This will make me not go as much or for awhile at least. One thing that was another turn off was how loud the band was. You couldn't even talk at the table they were so loud. \n\nIt's sad because I crave the fondu but I don't crave the cover charge.

She did not alert me of the pricing of the $20 application for the service and while I stood there staring at her waiting for assistance to buy products she gossiped with another employee about me. I have to say that I have bought many eyelashes from your store here because it was tradition for my friends in vegas, but after they saw how she treated me they did not even want her help. I suggest you help your employees with their attitude problems - Vegas is supposed to have great service experiences everywhere and I must say my friends were treated very kindly at Sephora.

Look to Omnia or XS.\n\nFor a nightclub that is supposed to be all the rage with top headliners, Hakkasan falls short. Sure, Hakkasan has great lighting and they frequently have great DJ's there. But what is the point of a nightclub if you don't have space to dance, get good drinks, or have decent customer service?\n\nAfter going there a few times, it is evident that promoters and bouncers emphasize the importance of getting there early to avoid being turned away due to reaching capacity. This couldn't be farther from the truth. If you want to go to a nightclub that is a fire hazard then Hakkasan is the place for you. It is always super (SUPER) packed. With the exception of the few groups who managed to get a table, there is no room to dance or breathe without interjecting yourself into someone else's personal space.\n\nThat said, what is the point of paying $40 for a cocktail if the bartender doesn't even know what he is doing? Worst experience: I asked for 2 AMF's (a very well known drink that every reputable bartender should know) and instead of serving me a drink that is made up of different alcohols (the whole definition of Adios Mother F's) the bartender thought it was okay to poor a bit of 1 vodka, splash juice, top it off with curacao (gives it the blue color) and call it a day. Excuse me but what? And yes, they still had the audacity to charge for an \"AMF\".\n\nTo add to the Hakkasan experience, the bouncers at this venue always make sure to be disrespectful to guests (even when you have VIP). For some odd reason these \"gentlemen\" forget that they get paid to do a specific job that happens to include providing customer service. It behooves me why a respectable resort like the MGM would employ individuals who are more interested in looking good for each other than doing a good job and making a good impression on guests.\n\nIf you can't resist and want to see what the \"fuss\" is all about make sure to grab a cocktail beforehand.

Back in June I had a little accident with my 2012 Honda Civic Si, I was told Kustom Koachworks did a good job, but the person who referred me had to have been talking about the Mesa branch. As as far as getting the dents out of the metal they did a good job the rest, forget it. Had to take it back to replace the belt moulding, and have weather stripping fixed. As I keep finding mistakes I am not happy. They failed to put on the decal that says i-VTEC DOHC, the inside door panel was ruined, when I had to remove the front bumper to replaced my A/C condenser because it ate a rock (the condenser was not their fault) I found broken and missing clips, screws were not in the right places, the door has atleast a quarter inch gap, I know this by comparing the drivers side and being able to stick my key chain in between door and body which I can't on drivers side, when discussing this with the so-called technician he said \"something that is so significant of a cunt hair is not worth fixing\" his words not mine thank you, sort of pissed me off. Not only is my door panel ruined they used a screw driver to remove the plastic piece that is supposed to uncover the two screws in order to remove the door panel. I guess that sets apart real auto technicians from body shop technicians. I was assured that the alignment was good, yet upon further inspection I found the rear wheel toed in and was dog-tracking and was not provided with before and after sheet. Thankfully I can fix everything else and I work for a Honda dealer and can get parts at a significant discount. I feel like an ass for telling my insurance company to send my car here. Next time if I need a body shop I will be going to the Mesa branch. To my suspicion they half assed the job at the last minute, after all they told my insurance company it was done, when I went to retrieve my vehicle it was not, to find out it would be done by end of day. Why would my insurance company say it was done when it wasn't? When I took it back, said unprofessional tech left dusty boot and finger prints all over my car. Just because I am wearing a uniform for another shop doesn't give that piece of shit to talk to me the way he did and leave my car dirty.", "type": "review", "business_id": "LN2RHGnZOKN8_pd7WVlbrQ"}

Only two small bowls of pineapple and watermelon hidden by the meats and then a few berries in the dessert section. The salad section is an absolute joke. It consists of 2 types of lettuce and about 4 types of toppings and a few dressings. This should be unacceptable to any normal human considering about 50-75% of our diet should be vegetables and fruits. I was extremely disappointed.\n\nService:\nIt took about 45 mins to get in which was sort of expected. Once we were inside however there were many many open tables so it didnt make sense. Next it took 11 mins before a server came to take our drink order. It was nearly another 10 mins before she returned with the beverages. We had 6 people at our table and we just ordered waters and iced teas. Now each person made 3-4 trips to the buffet and at any one time there were at least 5 dirty plates on our table. Our server litterally only clear the table twice but never got Everything. This is how our table looked much of the time. http://bit.ly/Y5TCXN\n\nOverall the buffet is slightly over priced comparatively to most big name casino buffets. The food is tasty but seriously lacking in areas that are VERY important to a human diet. I say Skip it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "sIyHTizqAiGu12XMLX3N3g"}

I was assured all three times that as long as I got there early enough there would be no issue. I went to check in and the lady was so rude and told me that the rooms we booked didn't have the option of having attached rooms. I told her I called and confirmed three times to make sure and all three people said yes I could. She informed me she couldn't give us attached rooms and could only do across the hall. Lady pissed me off so I got my room and walked away. I then had to go find a manager and complain and asked why the people on phone told me one thing and the check in person another. He took my keys went in back checked something and came back and said I don't know why she told you that but I switched your rooms to attached ones. He didn't apologize and instead of giving us new room keys we had to go back up to counter to get rechecked in. Went up to our rooms they mixed up the room names but we just switched ourselves. The rooms were ok. The beds were comfy and the shower nice. The view sucked but I would definitely not pay a lot to stay here. The location is great but other than that nothing else is. Valet said they were closed so we had to park far away and drag all our luggage a couple blocks to the hotel.

They have no problem keeping clients waiting anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes however when I show up 12 minutes late they refused to do the service on my birthday. I understand you want to keep things on time however please be consistent and drop the double standard. It's not ok to make clients wait every time and not in return give the same grace period.

For better prices and service try red rock resort and spa or lifetime spa!\n\nAfter reading the reply-\n\nI think it's funny how they don't keep accurate facts. I was never 5 to 7 minutes late on a visit. In fact they had the audacity to ask me to come in early last week by half hour and when I did so still kept me waiting. Why bother asking me to come in early only to have me wait. Their notes are inaccurate because they fail to come to the front desk to check people in because they are having lunch and talking to each other in the back. If I'm waiting 15 minutes because you are eating or talking in the back please don't mark me late. This is why my experiences are so frustrating. You are on time and they still don't update the records. This is my opinion and based on experience. I'm a CPA so I understand numbers and accuracy.

The one star is not for them, but rather for my most recent visits. \nMy son was seen by Dr. Morris twice for excruciating pain in his feet. She took a set of xrays both times and ordered an MRI the second time. The MRI was a long time coming and I couldn't wait to get the results. Here's where the one star part comes in.\nI received a call from Dr. Morris' assistant who advised they had received the results of his MRI and asked if I would like to schedule an appointment to go over them with Dr. Morris. At this point, I had already figured out what was wrong with my son, but wanted to double check the MRI was negative just to ensure what we thought was the cause was actually the cause. I explained this to the assistant who informed me, \"Dr. Morris does not give MRI results over the phone because it is a HIPAA violation.\" The problem with this is that I work in the healthcare field and I know for a fact this is not true. I ended the call and called back after I had a chance to think about this and asked the front office girl to speak to a supervisor. She advised she would pass my information on to the supervisor but asked what it was regarding. I advised her I would like to talk to the supervisor regarding this incident. Because if it is just the doctor's policy, that's one thing; however, it is not now, nor has it ever been a HIPAA violation to give lab results over the phone. She stated, \"Yes it is.\" I laughed and told her, \"Now I really need to talk to your supervisor because, clearly, your office is misinformed and I'm not going to pay another copay or have my insurance pay for another visit just to be told, again, that she doesn't see anything. If your supervisor would like to show me exactly where, in the law, it states this, I'll be glad to come in at that time; however, I am sure this is wrong and if your office is telling people this just to get them in the door again, that's not clinically appropriate.\" \nShe advised she would pass my information to the supervisor who would call me back.\nI received a call from the supervisor who, apparently, has never had training in customer service in her entire life because she was the rudest, most incapable \"supervisor\" I have ever had the unpleasant experience of speaking to EVER.\nI answered the phone and she introduced herself and said she was told I would like to speak to her. I told her I had taken my son there and recently had an MRI for which their office has the results. I further stated I had received a call from the assistant who told me he could not give me the results due to HIPAA law. I told her I am not wanting to take time off work, take my son out of school and go all the way down there again when I have already been there three times, for the doctor to scratch her head and tell me she still doesn't know. I advised I think I figured out what the problem is and that if she would just be so kind as to tell me whether she sees something or it's negative, I can go from there. But, I don't want to go there again if there is nothing to discuss. \nThe supervisor then told me, \"Okay, well, first of all, you've only been here twice. (Whatever. Two times, three times, fifty times, that is not the point.) And it is the doctor's policy to go over the results in person.\"\nTo which I said, 'Okay, if that's the case then that is fine and THAT is what your staff should be telling people because that is not a HIPAA violation. It has nothing to do with HIPAA and...\" She interrupted and told me in a rather snotty tone that she had through the entire conversation that SHE will handle that part but, \"Do you want to schedule an appointment or not?\" \nLet me just say this: I said, several times, that if there is something we need to discuss on the MRI in person, I'll gladly go down there, but if there is nothing on it, she can tell me that on the phone and I will continue to pursue the course of action I had felt was necessary. As I was stating this, she interrupted again to tell me that \"yelling\" at her was not going to do any good. To which I replied, \"I'm not yelling. I'm simply talking to you about this situation.\" She then said, \"I guess that's just your voice then.\" WTF is wrong with you, lady? First of all, I am a customer who is trying to figure out what to do about a situation that you are making more difficult than it needs to be. SECOND, the bottom line is not whether or not I want to take time off or whether or not I pay a copay or whether or not your staff are incompetent. The point is my son is in pain every single day. He is ten years old and up until four months ago, he was fine. And you can let your incompetent doctor know it was a medication side effect she should have caught. Also, the results were sent to another doc as well who gave me the results ON THE PHONE.", "type": "review", "business_id": "g0zlaGZ04NnJWRkC4NRE4A"}

Walking into the office, the front office staff has the TV blaring on the news and cannot be bothered to greet the patients walking in as they were too busy speaking Spanish amongst themselves.  No biggie, I was there to see the doctor after all. \n\nI was called back by Juana, the CNA, who was knowledgeable and personable - she gave me hope for the establishment. I disrobed and waited patiently for Dr. Ceballos, who came in a while later. She smiled and introduced herself but that was where the formalities stopped. I was there for my annual check-up but also because I was experiencing some major discomfort with chronic UTI's. I tried to explain to her what I was feeling but she would not even let me talk. She was very dismissive and stated if I knew what was causing them that I should just stop having sex ( this seems to be her favorite diagnosis). I tried to tell her what I was experiencing was not normal and that I had already had 4-5 UTI's thus far and it wasn't even June yet. She stated those needed to be documented which was understandable -we agreed I would get all of my UTI diagnoses' over to her for review and treatment. She did not examine my breasts which I thought was weird as I was there for my annual checkup. Feeling talked down to and like my health issues were completely irrelevant, I left the office crying. \n\nThree weeks passed and I never got a call regarding my results. Being concerned as I went for an annual and because I was experiencing major discomfort, I called the office and a staff member informed me \"she got the results back she just hasn't looked at them yet.\" That day, the office called me and advised my PAP was irregular and I had to come back for a colposcopy (this came to no surprise to me as I tried to explain something was wrong on my first visit to her) The next appointment they had was 4 weeks later and against my better judgment, I reluctantly took it. \n\nDreading my upcoming visit with Dr. Ceballos, I recruited my significant other into coming to my procedure with me. Once again Juana was friendly and welcoming - she explained the procedure and asked if I had any questions. Dr. Ceballos then came into the room and was very curt and acted like she didn't really have time for this. I told her I talked to my primary doctor about a couple of symptoms I was having who suggested I talk to her (Dr. Ceballos) about a couple of possible causes. Dr. Ceballos stated my primary doctor should stay out of it and leave the \"gynecology\" business up to them. My significant other then reminded her the only reason we had to go to a primary doctor was because her office was too busy to see me and that she was very dismissive of my symptoms, to which she did not respond (mind you she already had her hands on the door handle ready to walk out to see her next patient even though I still had some concerns). We then asked her about treatment options for my chronic UTI's to which she replied she couldn't do anything until she had documentation proving I have had 4-5 UTI's like I had mentioned previously. We reminded her she had that documentation; however she said Juana could answer the rest of our questions and left. My procedure was performed mid-august and my follow up was scheduled for mid-September. \n\nFeeling like she definitely couldn't be bothered with my issues and being very condescending every time I tried to ask a question, I decided to pull my medical records and take them to another gynecologist. To my surprise, she noted my breasts were fine and no irregularities were found on them - not exactly sure how she could have possibly known any of that as she didn't even bother to give me a full examination.  If you want a doctor with bedside manners - go somewhere else. If you want a doctor that will bother with a full annual examination - go somewhere else. If you want a doctor that listens to your problems and treats your symptoms - go somewhere else. If you're looking for a doctor  that is condescending, notes she performed procedures she didn't and talks down to you - Dr. Ceballos is definitely the doctor for you.", "type": "review", "business_id": "wPe2KIMZISopEBPq0vnqwA"}

Full autos blasting and shells flying and so crowded it was dangerous\n\nTotally disorganized.  They wanted the ten of us to shoot in one lane.

I found the office staff to be friendly but there was quite a bit of paperwork to fill out. I only gave 2 stars because this doctor was just OK. He seemed a bit akward, to the point that it even made me feel a little uncomfortable or uneasy. He didn't take much time with me and didn't really offer much advice. Just gave me a trial pill and sent me on my way. Not the worst doctor in town, but I'm sure there's better.", "type": "review", "business_id": "JTjeH2-D8NtLGHXTO5S8sw"}

I am late with this but this is my first post ever but wanted to alert people.  We spent Easter Sunday with 6 people, stated with a couple bottles of champagne, then wine with food, spent above average for sure.  Bill comes and we throw 3 credit cards in - fortunately one for us looked at the bill - the service charge was about 50% of the food and drink total!!!  He asked for the manager, who looked puzzled and said it was a mistake and they would re-run the ticket and I think he comped our deserts.  This cannot be an accident - its a computer!!  \nI am guilty of trusting restaurant checks at higher end places and not scrutinizing them - never again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9Bnc9YP0n5cR57xkP6fQmQ"}

The egg itself was cooked great and the flavor was amazing. The home fries however were barely cooked through and had no flavor.
