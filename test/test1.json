Really good variety of machines, classes and unlike LVAC, people actually work out here instead of using it as a social club. My problem is with the staff. i had an issue with my membership and tried to ask about it. The staff at the front desk said i needed to call the customer service number and speak to them so i did. I actually called twice and got the same answer both times from the operators, i could cancel my membership or talk to a club manager about my current one. Now i've been going to this gym for 3 years and i really like it here so i decided to talk to a manager about it. I've asked to speak to a manager 4 separate times and each time the same thing happens: The staff at the desk will tell me that the manager is with another guest or not there and that i can have a seat and they'll see me next. So after 20 or 30 minutes of waiting the person at the desk will tell me they don't know how much longer the manager will be and that i can leave my name/number and the manager will call me, so i do. I have never gotten a call back ever out of the 4 times this has happened. I understand that this is a gym and not some high end restaurant or retail store so i don't expect amazing customer service and its a busy gym so i don't expect help right away but to be ignored is ridiculous. Either the manager isn't getting my messages or they're ignoring it. The only reason I haven't canceled my membership yet is because like i said, i've been going here for 3 years and i really like it but this is beyond unacceptable and I've started looking at other gyms.", "type": "review", "business_id": "7TJfPxT1VhpkvacFbph8NA"}

My husband could/would eat pizza everyday of his life if I permitted. When we went back to visit his parents he actually took me on a pizza tour of the area all of which ended with his absolute favorite pizza, Aurelio's. His love for this pizza stems from childhood and I honestly do not think you could convince him that there is a greater pizza out there. I even once looked into shipping Aurelio's for a birthday present and quickly realized that that was insanely expensive. \n\nFast forward to this summer when I discovered a review on Yelp that mentioned that there used to be an Aurelio's here in AZ that eventually became Spinato's. Well my husband insisted that we get in the car that moment and check it out. The sweet marinara is exactly what he was looking for and while not exactly the same this is the closest pizza in Arizona to his beloved favorite. The crust is thin and the sausage is hand crumbled (or appears to be). They are very generous on the cheese and toppings in general and leftovers the next day aren't too shabby. We have never had an issue with service or our order on the several occasions we have been One of my favorite things about Spinato's is the ice, seriously I have a passion for crushed ice and lots of it!", "type": "review", "business_id": "YldXB1hRpnE1CWLF3mvgpQ"}

I make sure to come every time I'm in Vegas and this past visit, my boyfriend and I came here three times, lol.\n\nMy favorite dishes:\n~ Camarones a la Diabla: OMG!!  Best shrimp ever.  I love their spicy sauce and am so glad they give you the plate of complimentary bread so I can mop up all the leftover sauce.  Actually, the sauce would make anything taste good.  A must try!!\n~ Firefly Fries: Lots of garlic and parmesan cheese ~ delish!\n~ Paella: rice is tasty and they don't skimp on the seafood.\n~ Steamed Mussels: it comes in a coconut curry sauce that is good enough to drink.  Not very spicy but good curry flavor.  Mussels are very fresh and steamed to perfection.\n\nOther recommended dishes:\n~ Patatas Bravas\n~ Stuffed Dates\n~ Fried Calamari\n~ Empanadas\n\nNot so good dishes:\n~ Baked Brie: I think I didn't enjoy it much because the cheese wasn't as hot as I expected it to be and it wasn't that special.\n~ Terra y Mare Skewers: the filet mignon was really dry and wasn't very tasty in general.\n~ Tuna Tartare: the tuna was in huge chunks and not marinated enough.\n~ Caramel Flan: meh...I've had better flan, texture wasn't very smooth.\n\nOverall, still a great tapas place  Prices are pretty reasonable and it's just great being able to try a bunch of small dishes and not having to fill up on an entree.  Great place to have a few drinks and kick back with some friends or to have a romantic date.  Yay for Firefly!", "type": "review", "business_id": "8buIr1zBCO7OEcAQSZko7w"}

I had a veggie quesadilla but it was more like a Mexican calzone- I had to eat it with a fork. Seriously so much flavor and it was big enough to eat half and save for later but I'm a bad ass and ate almost all of it because that's how I roll.\n\nMy husband (the picky one) had a carne Asada burrito- just steak, beans and cheese plus he added sour cream. Two bites in we were already making plans to come back.\n\nThere were plenty of vegetarian and vegan options so I'm excited to go back and try something different next time!\n\nThey have a huge salsa bar but half of the salsas were missing descriptions so it was kind of a guessing game.\n\nThe horchata was huge and came with fresh fruit, nuts and cinnamon on top. It was good but not as thick as expected (I'm just a white girl from Kansas so I'm not an expert).\n\nCons:\nParking can be a pain- I tried to come on a Saturday night and eventually gave up because I was already in a bad mood.\n\nThe chips were nothing special and salt would not stay on! They were free though so not holding that against them. \n\nFrom the one $, I expected the prices to be cheaper. I wasn't even sure if there would be waiter service. For a burrito, quesadilla, horchata and two negra models (on special) it came to $32 and change plus tip.\n\n\nOverall, we were very satisfied and will definitely be back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zp713qNhx8d9KCJJnrw1xA"}

Has to be the most useless HOA in existence.  There is no maintenance staff to clean up, pull weeds, recommend repairs (but there is a person with this title that collects a paycheck for $22.50/hr).  My street is like driving on a dirt road and I have a \"lawn\" growing out back (no seed or sprinklers necessary... just lack of maintenance) If you make a complaint in the meetings, they laugh at you and call you a whiner.  Then, they will put out a letter to all the homeowners to belittle the \"whiner\".  We had a guy in the community (whom is now on the board, thankfully...but they always outvote him) that complained to the county about unsafe lighting.  The HOA was forced to correct the code violation.  The HOA pouted and ripped out all the security lighting 2 years ago with no replacement or repair, and it's been dark and dangerous around here ever since.  Then they put out a letter belittling the man for making what they summed up as unnecessary trouble and calling everyone that complains about anything \"the cabal\".  It is commonplace for them to try to intimidate the other homeowners.  They even cut down your trees without replacement if you \"make trouble\".  But the HOA president (Maryann \"andy\" Beam) has a garden of eden behind her unit, and I won't mention her decaying wall out front (homeowner installed, not original).  The board does not hold themselves to the same standard as the other homeowners.  They authorized themselves to have extra trees and bushes and ceiling fans on their front porch but the rest of the community gets neglected.  There is also a drug house (or maybe a brothel) that attracts disgusting vagrants regularly at all hours of the day and night.  They jump the wall by my place because it's only 5 feet high.  They pee on the wall and smoke drugs right outside my back patio.  The HOA REFUSES to do anything about them and writes off the problem as \"we can't do anything about it, they're invited by the homeowner\".  There is always trash and shopping carts around that unit, all they have to do is start fining them and build up the violations to a priority lien but they are scared of them (or maybe they're customers, that makes more sense). The old president cared about the community and took complaints seriously and, at least, investigated them.  One homeowner got a threat of a fine because some Mexicans were partying at the pool and left chicken bones everywhere and they blamed it on him because he's Mexican (everyone looks alike when you're a bigot).  He wasn't even here at the time; he lives in California and only stays here when he visits Las Vegas.  They didn't check ID of the offenders or take photographs or even review the surveillance footage (they always claim the cameras are broken).  \n\nTo sum it up:  If you want to be belittled, bullied and victimized for $157 a month, come join the Duck Creek Condominium community today!", "type": "review", "business_id": "arsbI8qhYcX5NW0-gffezQ"}

I got 3 nights for $43 TOTAL! That's right, $43! It was suppose to be $50+ because apparently the gold coast charges $3 per night for hotel fees or whatever fancy thing they call it.\n\nIf you have your own transportation while in Vegas, this is very close to thes trip. It's right off Flamingo and Las Vegas Blvd. It's right next to the Rio & the Palms. Even if you don't have your own vehicle, they offer FREE SHUTTLE service to the strip and their other Coast affiliated hotels (Sun Coast, The Orleans). Because it is really close to the strip, even just getting a taxi should be affordable. Bellagio is 1-2mins away by car. That is how close the Gold Coast is. \n\nThe Vegas hotel/casino experience is not loss by staying at this hotel. Gold Coast is decently sized. \n\nSo how are the rooms, the pictures already submitted on Yelp, give you an idea of how they regular rooms are. As soon as you walk in, the beds are there. I actually like the bathroom to be right when you enter, with the beds on the further end of the room. The toilet and shower/tub are the only thing enclosed. The sink/vanity is open. So if you are sharing with other people, prepare to bring your clothes in the small space where the toilet and tub/shower are unless you feel comfortable. Some might like this setup for those who take long showers, and you just want to use the sink. So very subjective here.\n\nWe got 2 beds, which I believe were Full size. Room seemed clean enough, but move the bed forward, I uncovered a bunch of dust accumulating. So if you have allergies, watch out. It wasn't a problem for me, but for others it might be.  The beds were comfy enough, but many will say they have slept in better, including myself. The pictures that someone submitted here is what you get. No comforter! But the blankets provided were enough to keep us warm. \n\nThe rest of the room was ok. For the price we paid, it as better than expected. The wall mounted LCD HDTV was a nice touch. However nothing was actually in high definition. So what was the point? I guess a lot of people are still suckers out there. Remember folks, an HDTV is not worth getting if you are only going to be displaying a crappy non-HD source. \n\nINTERNET ACCESS IS NOT INCLUDED. It is $12.99 for 24hours. Either wired or wireless. It was fast though. FASTER THAN HILTON HOTELS (Hampton Inn, Embassy Suites, Doubletree, etc). The Hilton hotels cap their speed per user. Here, they probably do as well, but not as low, because it was much faster.\n\nThey have a huge bowling alley that is open 24hrs I believe. With happy hour where bowling is only $1 and $1 shoe rental. \n\nThe rest of the hotel was fine. It is obviously not the Wynn, but if you are on a budget, yet still want some decency in the hotel you are staying at, I recommend the Gold Coast.", "type": "review", "business_id": "t0yVlH_n9_eEZskHwr5cnQ"}

I enjoyed both, especially because the chile rellano wasn't heavily coated with batter. Came with soup, which I liked so much I also had the hubby's portion. For dessert, we ordered the fried ice cream which I liked. Ice cream is a combination of 3 flavors (I think caramel, vanilla and chocolate?) and was still very cold inside the deep fried batter, but the batter was chewier than I expected.\n\nMy overall experience was good. The only thing that dampened it was there was a large projection screen in the bar, which was showing the hockey game and the table next to us was overly loud and obnoxious with their hockey commentary.

If you think 12 bucks is too much for this bowl, go to some fast food franchise. The location is relatively small and intimate with ambient lighting in the evening. Additionally this is a BYOB establishment so feel free to bring your own wine or spirits...Try that at other Vietnamese restaurants!\n\nJustine is mind-blowing and awesome in her own way! She's the owner and also works at the establishment. She's straight forward and not afraid to speak her mind so she's not for the weak hearted.

A) Wearing the ring on the wrong finger so it doesn't fall off OR B) Not wearing it at all.  I say not wearing it at all, especially if your ring is as perfectly gorgeous as mine is.  I couldn't leave it in the sad little box all alone at home.\n\nI took my new ring into a few stores to get quotes on the sizing and all of the places said I would have to leave it over the weekend because that is when the jeweler was working.  What a bummer!  The weekend is when I want to show everyone my new ring and announce my engagement.  It didn't seem like much fun to do one without the other.\n\nThen, on a Wednesday afternoon, I decided it wouldn't hurt to check with the jewelry store across the street from my office, Renaissance Fine Jewelry.  I had a few watch batteries replaced there a while back and was very happy with the quality and speed of the service.\n\nAfter showing the jeweler my ring, he was the first (and only) one to point out a few things about the ring that would cause challenges with the re-sizing process.  I was impressed.  Then he said he could I would most likely be able to pick up the ring on Friday.  That was music to my ears; I would have it for the weekend!!!\n\nHow could he do this so quickly when the other places wanted to keep my ring for 5-6 days?  I'll tell you why.  He is the guy; he IS the jeweler!  It is so nice to know that you are talking to the person who is actually doing the work!\n\nThe best part was I didn't even have to wait until Friday!!  My ring was ready for pick up less than 24 hours later!  Fantastic!  Yes, his price was a little higher than the other places, however for the upfront identification/notification of the challenges, the friendly service, and the speedy turnaround, it was worth every dime!\n\nNow if I only had more jewelry to take to Renaissance . . .  =)", "type": "review", "business_id": "cBH0kCvvUjQ9DBaAMUDSMw"}

It's like, my dream restaurant come true! (Pinch me!) The parking lot has various entrances, plenty of space and is clean. The inside of Fez is remarkable, from cool lighting fixtures to fresh color palettes all around. The food is mouth watering and almost perfect. The menu is a bit on the pricey side I must admit which means I cannot visit this glorious place more often. I gave Fez four stars because 1.) The last time I visited them it took FOREVER (40 minutes) to get our main courses which were SALADS.. are you serious? How long does it take to make a meatless SALAD?! 2.) Our waitress wasn't all that great, my throat was about to croak from a need of a refill after 30 minutes. She was also very unapologetic after we waited so long for our food.  So, once Fez gets a QUICKER staff, it will get my five stars :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "EWMwV5V9BxNs_U6nNVMeqw"}

The shoe department is very impressive. I've found some really nice shoes here on numerous occasions, for way less- score! \n\nThere are registers in the front and back of the store (at each entrance). There is a security guard.

Opting for one starter to precede a duo of entrees it would not be long before the best bites of the meal would arrive and served as a quintet the Mac & Cheese balls each proved not only sizable but also quite delicate, the crackling panko overlying supple pasta with briny bits of bacon imbuing each bite plus a sidecar of cheese sauce for those desiring even more cream.  At this point happily conversing about recent events as background music played on it was after only the slightest of delays that three trays would arrive and with the kitchen opting to split our French Toast while the sandwich was served whole it can only be said that neither dish tasted as good as it looked, the brioche too lightly soaked and thinly sliced to allow the exterior to be rendered crisp without burning it while the waffle was chewy and lifeless, a bready detriment to otherwise pleasant chicken and bacon served alongside entirely forgettable, yet all too trendy, 'tots.'\n\nNot exactly a disaster in that the service was pleasant while the Mac & Cheese Balls were far better than standard pub-grub suffice it to say that for those not interested in being upsold on cleverly named cocktails or craft beers Park on Fremont has little to offer - a quick walk down the street to MTO, eat, S+O, Carson Kitchen, or DuPar's offering far more extensive selection with equal or better value on the dollar at each.", "type": "review", "business_id": "itFwrNtjrQL5NPMYTeD44g"}

I know the dinging is supposed to indicate the sounds of a winner, but in reality, it's more like an electronic carnival barkers.\n\n\"Ding! Granny here won\" \"Ding! Come-on, hear how loose we are\" \"Ding! Another social security check in, 25 cents out\"!\n\nDing! The idea strikes me: I have to get out of here. So for a day of R&R I hopped into the rental car and headded off to the Pinball Hall of Fame.\n\n*Ding-Ding-Ding* You are welcomed at the door by a familiar sound.  But these arent demanding dings.  They are warm and friendly.  A sound from childhood - or at least of a more innocent time.\n\nDing! Each ding pops the magical metal sphere around the table.  I'm on a machine built in 1958, well before I was born.  It's only a quarter, and I'm sucked into a game of skill.  Target shooting, bouncing off bumpers.  I don't care about work, breaking even, or my bad back.  I am a kid again, without a care in the world.\n\n*Ding-Ding-Ding*  The game ends and the last few bonus points ring up.  Occasionally your skilled play is enough to earn a free game.  You feel like a champion - a pinball wizard.  You hold your head high and soon you are off to the next game.\n\nDing! What a find.  Most of the machines have little cards on them, giving you a little background on the machine.  Some machines are extremely rare, one of only two in existance.  Unlike any other museum, not only can you touch, you can play them.  You are even encouraged to do so.  Try playing with the bronze heads in the football hall of fame.  They won't even let you pick Larry Csonka's nose.\n\n*Ding-Ding-Ding*  Three hours pass, and I have $4 left from the twenty I put into the change machine. I know I'm still in Las Vegas, but for once, I feel good about putting more money into a machine than I am taking out.  In fact, I'd feel guilty for getting so much fun for so little money.  I'd feel guilty, if I didn't feel like such a kid.\n\nPlunk.  As cool as this place is, it is seriously lacking in aesthetics.  A hall of fame should be a place that a machine designer should be proud to have their creation in.  A grand building paying homage to those inside.  This is just a warehouse with a plastic banner stretched outside.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9Ywv51iCL_QSIGzFA6vqiQ"}

Oh I forgot, they provide an aromatic hot towel as well.\nSo, I specifically told the girl short on the sides and a little less than 1/4\" off the top. I was trying to grow my hair out.  I may be wrong in my lingo, but that sounded pretty straight forward.  So she did the sides which were fine, then she started going at the top...and started at the middle.  So it was too late for me to even stop her.  SHe took off quite a bit.  Her stories were filled with her desire to get out of work early and drinking during the weekend.\n\nI told her the problem after she asked me if she made it the proper length.  I said...hmm...negatory.  She apologized and said, let's go wash your hair (after the cut?!)  She sat me down on this massage chair which just friggin vibrated, wtf...wait let me reiterate.  WTF!  Then she put the towel on my face, which was the best part of the experience.  It smelled amazing!  She stated \"Don't you just want to fall asleep?\"  I thhought to myself, \"the vibrations are annoying and my hair is back to square one\"  She then brought me back to the first room and proceeded to blow dry and style my hair.  Wait, she also gave me a \"shoulder rub\"  with a little device that looked like a character from the Snorks.  She applied minimal pressure, I barely felt anything, and she said \"doesn't that feel good?\"  Omb.  When she styled my hair she tried desperately to make it longer and gave me little curls in the front.  I was disgusted.

As I tell people at the elite events, many times over apparently, I live literally \"this close\" to the sharp edge, so I go fairly often - at least once a week. Sharp Edge recently underwent a makeover - Enter and you're greeted with a large L-shaped bar, a sectioned off seating area to the right, and a large expansion in the back which is also seating. It can get crowded at times, but if you're only two-people deep you can pretty much walk in whenever.\n\nFirst thing's first: Sharp Edge is expensive for what it is. Beers here are definitely on the high end($5+ is the minimum, $8-11 is the upper end) and the food is generally over $10. While I think the beer can be worth it, especially if you make educated beer decisions(Hint: That $6 Magic Hat probably isn't on the 'good-buy' list) - the food leaves to be desired for what you're spending. I've found the service to be spotty at worst, good at best. The bar has great service when they get around to you, and to an extent same with the servers - but it seems slightly inconsistent that some servers are a cut above the others.\n\nSomething magical happens to Sharp Edge a few times a week that catapults this place into Pittsburgh's best spots. Every night after 10pm, Sharp Edge has a late-night menu where many appetizers are half off, including large pizzas and some other times. That means that you can get their amazing Mediterranean nachos(seriously, these are worth it) for about $5, a large pizza for $6, 'frites' for $3.50, and what I just learned tonight, the $0.45 boneless wing bites also come in a tofu version.. That's right vegetarians, nearly the entire late-night specials menu has at least a vegetarian option. Can't go without the chicken? They choose natural stuff from Ohio.\n\nAs if the food deals weren't enough to entice you, every wednesday all day, all craft beers are half off(Bringing them down to about $3-$4 each). Can't make it in on a Wednesday, you say? Why not stop in for happy hour - Half off belgians make them cheap by comparison($4-5 each). Unfortunately, they do their happy hour a half hour early - 4:30-6:30. If that's too early for you, stop in any time and enjoy their Mystery Draft. This is one of my favorite things about this place - a beer that you order without knowing what it is. At only $3.50, it's the cheapest on the menu - usually something good too. How do you know what it is? Come in after the keg is kicked and they'll write down the last one on a chalk-board. For example, the last Mystery Beer was a Peak Organic IPA.\n\nThis place can get crowded, but if you're brave enough to come during a Steelers game they also have specials for that. The mystery drafts go down to $0.86 each if Hines Ward scores, along with a handful of other deals.\n\nAll in all, Sharp Edge excels if you know when to come. I find myself in here almost every wednesday, at least, but sometimes more. If you come thursday at 7:30, be prepared to be underwhelmed, but the Sharp Edge is a great neighborhood bar with an excellent and often-changing beer selection that you can come out ahead at if you plan it right.", "type": "review", "business_id": "JuaQPvvWdbJ1B1Tn0jIt1w"}

My husband's chicken taco was the best! The chicken was tender and succulent. The rice and beans were both very good as well, not at all greasy. I loved the salsa bar. They had a pico de gallo, a red sauce, 2 different types of green chile sauces, jalapenos, both pickled and fresh, and pickled carrots and onions. That reminds me of the Mexican places in San Diego.

Had so much fun on Sunday! I should start this review by saying I'm a terrible scaredy cat.... So I wasn't sure if there'd be many rides for me. Luckily I was able to enjoy almost all of them! Yes I'm the girl with the blood curdling screams. We arrived around 2pm and it was perfect. The place has a steady stream of people, but not so busy that we had to wait forever in line. We never waited more than fifteen min (End of season perk). Sometimes no line at all. Definitely great to go at this time of year. My friend found out it is half price after 2pm, and I think that is a great deal. Although if you plan to go more than 3 times, you may be better off getting the season pass. \n\nMy absolute favorite ride is the half pike. I was originally too scared to ride it, but so glad my friend talked me into it. You go down a short tunnel, and then it feels like the bottom drops out & you fall straight down & immediately up what looks like a skate board wall and back down again. So much fun! This ride requires the combined weight of both riders to be 200. They actually put you on a scale to confirm, but don't worry it is more of a pass/fail rather than actually saying your weight. If the scale shows a green light, you are good to go. \n\nMy 2nd favorite ride (and the Bf's fav) was the new Tornado. It can take up to 4 people per ride. This one sends you down a tunnel and then into a giant funnel like 'tornado' sending you back & forth up the funnel sides. Thrilling & awesome! \n\nPersonally I also really liked Rattler & Zipp, Zapp, Zoom. rattler is another one that allows 4 people. A fun pink & green twisting & turning slide. The ZZZ is definitely very calm and I was able to build up some confidence. \n\nI think it is great that they offer complimentary sun screen. Also all of the staff were incredibly fun & friendly. I really felt like the employees working the rides took time & care to ensure safety, but also keep it fun. \n\nMy only concern is pricing. I feel tickets/season passes & etc are all a little high for what is offered. I am sure they plan to add more rides, so I can't wait to see what else they bring. \n\nWe went back to the alcohol dining area and I recommend getting the Stella. It tasted so good. Food is on par with what you would expect. Nothing fancy. Chicken fingers were pretty good with quality ranch (some ranch is terrible) and I definitely liked the criss cut fries. Our server was great, I think his name was Jason. (I feel like it was spelled a different way though) That's what I get for waiting a few days to finish the review. \n\nAlso our cabana waitress was great. When we came back after our first round of rides, she had left some water & her number in case we needed her for anything. Very nice touch! Great job Wet n Wild, I'll be back next year just trying to decide between season pass or single visits.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ril2PCGrL8OrXhTE8yZG4w"}

It had a clean scent - no trace of cigarette smoke - and a friendly environment.\n\nThis hotel is definitely a place for people who want to come to vegas and enjoy a weekend, but don't want to be suffocated with the bad air and company. It's so classy, it makes me forget that I'm even in vegas. \n\nThe rooms are nice and spacious. Each room is equipped with a kitchenette with a fridge/freezer, stove, microwave, sink and dish washer, as well as dishes and glassware for your convenience. For an additional $50 a night, my party was upgraded to a bigger suite in which the bedroom was separated from the living room and there were 2 full (shower, sink, toilet) bathrooms (a master bath and one in the living room area). \n\nThe perks? Free bottles of water in the lobby - just ask! And a shuttle that runs to Caesar's Palace every half hr and one to Wynn continuously until midnight. \n\nThe downsides:\n- valet parking only (it's free for guests, but you have to tip and it takes awhile to get your car)\n- not much around - there's the restaurant and bar by the lobby, and a little giftshop, but there isn't really much else. You can walk across the street to the Fashion Mall though. \n\nOverall, a nice place to stay, but not the party hotel for college kids. \nThis is, however, a great place for a more quiet vegas weekend for a couple looking for a romantic getaway or a family with kids.", "type": "review", "business_id": "eP9T-2a94ChFAl1Rd2R0jg"}

Not only have I not had the opportunity to dine at a Jose Andres restaurant before, but I was especially excited for the vaunted dessert.\n\nOf course, we had to have a meal before that part. We started by sharing the scallop & pork siu mai and huhhot (lamb) siu mai (each $9.88 for 6 pieces). The scallop & pork stood out less than the lamb and cumin morsel. Both were savory and juicy, with a delicious wrapper. They're about average size for siu mai, but I thought that they vanished pretty quickly without leaving a lasting impression.\n\nSInce I was in a good mood after the defeat of the losing Super Bowl team, I also had a Five-Spice Old-Fashioned cocktail ($10.00). I know little about cocktails, but this one had the full alcoholic punch while not tasting too strongly of alcohol. The giant ice cube kept the drink cold while not melting too quickly. The fruit garnish was pleasant and not alcohol-soaked. I wouldn't mind having it again.\n\nMy entree was the Hakka Fried Rice Pot ($16.88). Our server told us that this would be enough for two people to share, whereas the larger size was more suited for four, and I was pretty happy with the portion size. They have a special presentation of sorts, where a senior wait staff member opens the pot table-side, pours in a soy broth, adds an egg and chili oil to your level of heat preference, and mixes the contents of the pot for you. The same person did this at all tables that ordered the rice pot.\n\nI think the rice pot was quite delicious. Parts of the rice had crunch from being cooked in contact with the pot. The soy broth instilled umami and a balanced salt flavor. Pork belly was tender and tasty, lap cheong (sweet Chinese sausage) was delicious as expected. Mushroom was nicely cooked and more enjoyable than the wood ear fungus for me, the latter of which was sadly not cut into small pieces.\n\nI also sampled the other entrees, which I was glad for due to the presence of noodles in all of them. The Lo Mein ($14.88), Dan Dan Mian ($14.88), and Beijing Tomato ($12.88) all had tasty fresh pulled noodles. The dishes all seemed balanced enough, and the Dan Dan Mian is mild-medium in spiciness at best. No complaints about any of them.\n\nWe finally arrived at the much anticipated dessert. For those who don't know, this is a Taiwanese treat called xue hua bing, which is also available in town at Snowflake Shavery. I ordered a raspberry shaved snow (the \"shaved ice\" name sounds so Hawaiian) with crunchy chocolate pearls, Maldon salt, blueberries, and honey ($8.88). We also had a smaller sized malted milk snow with caramelized rice, tapioca pearls, and diced mango ($5.88). After comparison, the larger size seems to be a better value and a better way to enjoy this treat.\n\nThe shaved snow was quite similar in texture to the one at Snowflake, aka merely the second-best texture I've had. The flavors were pretty outstanding, however. The honey played with the snow in a very interesting way that somewhat overwhelmed the raspberry flavor, so I couldn't actually taste the raspberry too much. I didn't detect the salt either, but the variety of chocolate spheres and the blueberries were both standout toppings. I also tasted the smaller snow dish and was struck by the unexpectedly hard crunch of the rice. I liked it a lot, and I'd certainly order it next time (unless the rumored demise of the SLS becomes a reality). Overall, it's an assertively flavored and not overly sweet dessert that seems to celebrates the multitude of toppings at least as much as the snow - a possible negative if you're a snow purist.\n\nNow, take 50% off all of the above prices. The four-star rating is predicated entirely on taking advantage of the Social Sundays pricing for locals, or else I would consider it average and/or overpriced. The dishes all felt like they were designed by somebody not Chinese doing Chinese food, albeit with plenty of care and quality ingredients. The service was spotty at times. We were seated at a table with only two place settings and had to request it from our server when we put in our order. We also had to request water refills, and we had slightly extended periods without seeing our server.\n\nOverall, I had an enjoyable experience with the locals-only special and enjoyed a good rendition of shaved snow. I would quickly direct others to other restaurants, Strip or off-Strip, that are more likely to impress.", "type": "review", "business_id": "QXffVRWRLx3pZzgN9KeQkA"}

I decided to eat at Thai Gourmet after seeing all the good reviews and I was definitely not disappointed. \n\nWe ordered the papaya salad (Thai style) and gyoza appetizers. The gyoza were tasty but I prefer homemade (who doesn't?). The papaya salad, however, was SO GOOD. Had a hint of spiciness without being overpowering and was very flavorful. I am tempted to order it as my entree the next time I visit.\n\nI ordered the massaman curry with chicken (they had run out of beef when I asked) while my family ordered the Thai fried rice (chicken), pahd kee mao (chicken) and one of the stir fry dishes (can't remember which, but it was combination meat). The massaman curry was delicious though I was a little disappointed that they had run out of beef. However, it was the end of the night. Because they were out of beef, the stir fry that was ordered with combination meat also didn't have any beef. I don't know if extra portions of the other meats were added in to make up for this. But I noticed that they did not inform us that the dish wouldn't have beef in it--when the server came back to our table, he said only that they were out of \"massaman beef\" and not beef in general. Did not personally try the fried rice but my father, who is extremely picky, absolutely loved it. However, my brother, who is also picky, said the pahd kee mao was just \"okay\" (it's normally his favorite dish).\n\nThai Gourmet is family-run but our food still seemed to arrive quickly despite having only one (maybe two?) chefs in the kitchen. I think if you come with a very large group then you might have to deal with only a couple of people getting their food at a time. Our group was small so it was pretty unnoticeable. Everyone there is super friendly and the environment was bright and clean.\n\nI knocked one star off since my family thought the pahd kee mao and stir fry was mediocre and because of the missing beef (and lack of notification) in the combination stir fry; however, I think Thai Gourmet is definitely worth a visit if you like Thai food. I'll definitely come back the next time I visit Phoenix.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3rqoxOasrRKxNubxjLSElA"}

This is sadly more common lately, but at least at the Valero's they waive the extra fee if you use their own gas station charge card.  Even using a Shell card, PnM doesn't give you the cash discount.

Their website is thoughtful enough to have pictures of most of the items.\n\nMost of what I've had here is a solid 4 stars.  In addition to the Fiery Noodles, I'd come back for the following:\nBlack Bean Noodles -Egg white noodle, black bean sauce, pork, onion, carrot, zucchini, green onion, poached egg.\nSteamed Broccoli - Lightly dressed in a sweet soy and most certainly worth the price! \nEggplant Salad -Grilled eggplant, cherry tomato, grilled shishito pepper, dressing.\nSurf & Turf Roll -Bulgogi meat ball, Chilean sea bass, red wine marinated pear.\n\nThe 30 hour Braised Pork Belly was good, but not one of my favorite renditions of Pork Belly.  I am also not typically a fan of Chicken Pottage and Moko's version didn't change my mind.\n\nI would still like to try their Chilean Sea Bass with Spicy Veggies, Shrimp Risotto, and Spicy Chicken Thigh.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-r_4cKz_A8tj_SkiOL50yQ"}

She is an expert on the Wells line, having been trained on this line and having served as a stylist next to a Wells rep for years. I needed my bronzey-blond highlights to disappear and I wanted to give my locks a color boost in line with the Fall season. She suggested an all-over chestnut, with caramel highlights and low light.

There wasn't forced awkward conversation and she was ok if we weren't talking at all. Very comfortable.\n3/ The haircut was just what I wanted. She helped give my hair movement and lots of style.

I am a former Kaiser HMO patient and had a great relationship as far as communications with my former OB/GYN.  That is NOT the case here.

As a my first visit, I filled out lots of documents about my health history and in the waiting room, I answered additional questions that were logged in a tablet.  When Janice saw me, I asked questions about birth control and getting pregnant at my age and which hospitals they work out to deliver babies.\n\nI got a bill for $ 338 that my insurance did not cover.  When I called the billing office at 480-963-4083 they told me that my conversation with Janice were not visit related.  I told them well if I can speak to a woman doctor about woman issues when can I on a yearly visit.  They said that it was a Pap smear visit and yearly exam ONLY visit. They why did they ask me about my health and all sort of other questions.  I can't ask them questions.  \n\nThe code the billing dept used was 99214 - which I learned for my insurance was diagnosis for INFERTILITY.  The invoice was not clear on this code type of charge per the billing office the code was for PROCREATIVE COUNSELING, HMMNN another name for family planning.  So at what point can you speak to your OB/GYN w/out getting charged on a yearly visit?   \n\nI am disputing this charge and WILL NOT GO BACK. I live in Maricopa, and I thought it would be convenient to have an HONEST OB/GYN.  This was not the case because the office procedure fee visits were NEVER discussed with me.

I left and then at 539pm she called my Cell phone and left message saying Monday 11/21/11 between 10-11am she will call me w/follow up. All day passed at 456pm called Niki and LM.  She called me back at 506pm and left a message since I got tired of my attempts. Her message stated that they had computer problems all day and could not call me back.

We should have skipped the desserts - both options were vanilla custard-based, one topped with Fruity Pebbles (somewhat cute, but very poorly executed).\n\nIn addition, our server seemed to lack experience and confidence - we had to ask to place our order AND had to ask for recommendations, as our server never introduced herself nor asked us if we'd ever dined there (no one had). \n\nHopefully the next season's menu will feature more \"grit\"...authentic Chinese and/or Southeast Asian flavors (ala Red Farm in NYC), b/c right now it seems they are trying too hard and missing.", "type": "review", "business_id": "jSqhVWUquT3fGREmNdKdUA"}

This was my daughter's first experience with a true dance class after taking \"dance\" classes where the kid's more or less just had fun to music.  She was so excited to have her pink leotard, her little ballet skirt and a tap and ballet shoes.  The first day of class I discovered that some of the girls in the class had already taken the same class several times, one for at least a year...but they weren't progressed to another class, the classes were designated by age, not by level.  So, the teacher went through the movements and expected the girls to follow along.  She did not stop to help them and showed frustration at then for not immediately following along.  Did I mention this is a class for THREE YEAR OLDS and it's the FIRST DAY OF CLASS?  Managing your expectations was definitely not part of the training here!  I thought about complaining, but then realized the instructor (who did not introduce herself) was actually one of the owners.  I decided to take her to a class on a different day, with a different instructor, hoping she would be less intense with such young children just starting out.  I was wrong.  This class was with the other owner, who opted to make multiple children cry.  Keeping in mind that this is a class of three year olds and it was only the second class, the instructor yelled at the girls for fidgeting while they were waiting for the other girls to take their turns.  My daughter came running out of the room and said she was told she would not be allowed to dance if she couldn't stand still until it was her turn.  Why anyone would think this was the way to treat such a young child is beyond me comprehension.\n\nI left two voicemail messages, sent an email, and a letter informing the Dance Project that we would not be continuing classes and to cancel all future enrollments after two classes.  They have an \"automatic renewal\" policy so I wanted to be sure that we were not automatically renewed.  No one returned my calls, my emails, or my letter.  Four weeks later, I received a call requesting my next payment.  Not only did they not return my calls, they either didn't notice, or didn't care that my daughter had not been in the class for  four weeks, but they wanted more money.\n\nAs a teacher, I want to ensure that my children develop a love of learning.  It is crucial that early teachers and learning experiences by positive so that children will want to continue to learn.  Fortunately, my daughter loves dancing, so she was willing to try another class (at another school of course) and she has been taking classes there for weeks now -- not only does she love it, she is thriving and learning quickly.", "type": "review", "business_id": "N9uuYe_SNfsLlMLPshoJAQ"}

While many people here praise the drinks, I had a nasty one. It was called the Bali something-or-other and came in a tiki mug. This, in hindsight, should have been a clue, but at the time it sounded fun and different. Everyone at our table tried it and made a face of confused horror. They were entertained watching me try to finish it for the next hour or so. I failed. \n\nOthers in our party liked their drinks for the most part, but it seemed pretty hit or miss. Maybe the bartender was trying his own product a little too much last night.  If I go back, I'll skip the drinks.\n\nOh, and they have a giant wall with all their drinks written on it, and after I stood there reading the wall they hand me a menu saying the wall is out of date and to go off the printed menu instead. I get that it has to be a pain to update that wall, but they made the decision to put it in there. Seemed rather amateur to me to make a wall sized menu and then have to tell people to not pay attention to it. \n\nThe food was much better than the drinks. Went with the 3 dish course, and it was more food than I needed by a long shot. The crudo (raw) part of the menu was fantastic. The risotto was quite tasty as well. Had the pork belly to wrap things up, which was incredibly tasty but about as fatty as you can get. The desserts were all amazing, and I had a few bites of the cherry strudel before giving up out of concern I may explode (and the headache my drink gave me).\n\nService was fantastic, and the decor was nice but spartan. Overall a good place. I'd give it a 4 for Food and a 2 for Drinks. I went with an overall 4 since they are more about the food, and we had no complaints there.

My bet is that they might order something different.\n\nLater in the month on the second trip, we tried to order the crab mac and cheese.  Nope, sorry, out of crab mac and cheese.  So instead I ordered the Chop Salad.  Amazingly, it didn't have pine nuts and the smoked salmon somehow turned into grilled salmon.  By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known.  Rather than attempt to fix the situation, the bartenders and servers all started to ignore us.  Finally the manager came over and I explained to him that what I had received in the Chop Salad wasn't anywhere close to what was described on the menu.  \n\nHe literally asked me, \"Oh, are you in the business?\"  \n\nNo, I just happen to be able to read, and I just happen to know what I'm eating.  \n\nHe explained that they've been very busy and therefore had run out of lots of things.  Note to manager - smoked salmon, pine nuts, crab mac and cheese, and dark rum are not rare, exotic ingredients.  You run out of something, you go buy more.  Or you explain to customers that what they ordered isn't what they will get.  Apparently he didn't like hearing that there are some people that know the difference, and he started to treat us in a very condescending manner.  I'm not the douchebag here, buddy.  Clearly, YOU are the douchebag.  If you don't know how to run a restaurant, don't become a restaurant manager.  Simple.\n\nOh, lest I forget.  We had actually ordered 2 chop salads after being told that they counted under the 2-for-1 entrees grand opening special.  When we got the check, we had to have the bartender remove one of the salads as we were charged for both.  Almost got us, Regions.  Almost got us.\n\nSince my group was in a small rush to get to the La Bocca Yelp event, the manager - Keith? Kyle? Kevin? - offered to buy us a round if we came back later.  Not ones to ever refuse free alcohol, we did return later in the night after the yelp event.  And we brought lots of friends - our group of 5 turned into 11, all ready and willing to give Regions our business.  Lo and behold, the manager didn't comp us a round of drinks, even though we made it clear that's why we had returned and we were wiling to stay there if shown some love.  All he had to do was take the 5 kamikaze shots off the bill and it might have made up for the rest of the night.  Guess not.  Well done.  Love the honesty.\n\nIn conclusion:  food sucks, service sucks, management SUCKS.  But it benefits from a great location, so I'll probably wind up giving it another chance when in Tempe/Mill Ave.", "type": "review", "business_id": "F2Fxp4mQKOqSOYFEAOHnsw"}

Known for pitchers of sangria and fresh, tableside guac, it might as well be a bulls eye. \n\nWe've stumbled in on multiple occasions to this location. Friday nights, Saturday nights and Sunday afternoons. Optimal time for us is a weekend afternoon. Not buzzing with margarita vultures and other seekers of neon drinks with umbrellas in them. We're just here for the food, typically. However, I've seen quite a few neon blue margaritas floating around. They must be doing something right. Just not my cup of tea....er...booze. \n\nMy wife and I love the mushroom and goat cheese quesadilla. Perfectly simple and just enough pungent flavor to keep everything interesting. The goat cheese works perfectly with crispy, buttery outer shell of the tortilla. It's somewhat phyllo-esque upon each bite. So flaky and fragile. The mushrooms could be sauteed a bit better, but the flavors are all there. Huge win. \n\nThe tableside guac is an absolute win. Perfect amount for a table of four or two starvacious diners. Balanced well with tomatoes, onion and citrus. I'm not a huge fan of guac that has too many additives. Cantina does it up right. Smooth avocado and the rest of the veggies take care of the chunky aspects. My only gripe is the chips they give you to dip with. Not flat. All folded and intermingling with one another. I want my chips to be separate. Playing by their own rules. Not hugging one another. The flavor is all there. Just too much fraternization. \n\nLove Cantina. Now, to expand my horizons and check out some of this ever-present booze they have going on. Cheers!", "type": "review", "business_id": "0KNRmt72IWxI1JLpfpLwSA"}

Just recently they had a great turkey pesto sandwhich which sounds kind of ordinary, but it was way better than anything I can make at home. Their taco special with mock shredded beef was killer. They even have a Big Wac if you miss that nasty burger from McDonald's.\n\nMy favorite dishes are the No Harm Chicken Parm and Meatball sandwich. Their marinara is so flavorful! Lots of garlic, just how I like it. When I lived 10 minutes away and got take out, I could barely keep myself from eating while I was driving because it smelled sooooo good.\n\nWhen I'm aiming for something healthier, I get their stir-frys with extra fresh tofu, no rice.

It has been a great experience. I feel that it has really accelerated her development and learning. \nIt is now under new management and is undergoing changes. I will update my review again after everything settles. Miss Chris was the previous owner and was amazing. She lead every class and provided a ton of developmental information and enthusiasm. I think she will be hard to replace.\nThe best thing about gymboree was that you had unlimited classes. I could take my baby 4 days a week plus open gym for 60 something a month. They are supposed to get rid of that feature in April, if they do, then I will probably cancel my membership. I think having unlimited keeps more students in the class which enhances my babies interactions and learning. When she was in level 2, there were very few babies and most classes were empty, this made me wait to sign up for level 3, where there were more kids and more fun. Also, my work schedule keeps changing and I have different days off, it is way more convienent to pick and choose what class I go to. I do not see why it matters if you go to more than one class, the instructors still need to be there so I am not sure how they will save money. Anyways, that's just my 2 cents. I hope it stays unlimited so I have a great place to take my baby.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ie3Z-b4O7109XG_PidosKQ"}

Walking in to a big cow at the front entry - you KNOW there is going to be some serious beef/meat here.  The menu is full of extremely inviting options.... right from the start.  You sit down to popcorn out of a tin, while choosing what to drink.  How a person can NOT have a milshake is beyond me.  And no, not for dessert.. but to start :)  Whether bam boozled or regular you cannot go wrong.  Remember all bam boozled shakes you can get without the liquor mostly, for 3 bucks less.  So.... even if you don't want the alcohol OR are still drunk from the daily festivities Vegas has to offer... you MUST get a shake.  Tiramisu, Vanilla, Drunken Monkey, Birthday Cake... grasshopper... all YUM!  \n\nNext is to decide on the main.  The salads are huge.  Everything is really.  The burgers are large and so so fresh.  Meat piled high on a fresh bun... with so many tasty toppings.  The steakhouse burger is amazing... although I could stand a few less black peppercorns.  The classic burger is even an smooth choice.  If you want a mountain of meat on a bun, they have that too.  OR if you are looking for something without beef... I guess that option is also available.  I don't think there would be a bad option - and I love finding out :)  The fries are okay... the sweet potato fries are better..\n\nYou can watch TV while in there... you'll get great service... and you surely won't be disappointed.  And truly the prices aren't THAT extreme considering you're in The Cosmo on the Strip in Las Vegas!", "type": "review", "business_id": "BqrTtox0JbG-P_DKBB5bBw"}

A promised all-you-can-eat fried chicken meal with all the traditional fixings for $38 (cash only).\n\nIt begins with homemade biscuits and cornbread, both warm as if only recently taken from the oven.  The biscuits are hearty, the cornbread perhaps too fluffy as it came apart very easily.  Both are accompanied by butter and artisan honey, which was a great dip for the biscuits (and the chicken skin as well).\n\nThe entree is a mix of fried chicken served alongside mashed potatoes, collard greens, cheddar mac and cheese, and corn on the cob.  The chicken is well-cooked, with a batter of a unique blend of spices (guessing paprika, a touch of pepper, seasoned salt, and some oregano-like herb).  The collards are tasty with a hint of pepper kick, the mac and cheese is no-frills made with tasty cheddar, and the corn is seasoned with paprika.  The mashed potatoes weren't all too memorable, but skipping that at least leaves more room for the chicken.\n\nThe meal is capped off by warm peach cobbler with a dollop of fresh cream on top.  Fresh peaches, warm from the oven, and the cream supplied a satisfying note that helped temper the heat and sweetness of the cobbler.\n\nThe vibe for these dinners is a friendly one, people introduce themselves and experience the food alongside each other.  Natalie makes the rounds herself in her traditional plaid shirt and chuck taylors, making for a real communal ambiance that's in short supply in this town.\n\nYou have to either visit regularly or follow eat. on Facebook to find out when the next one is, but once it's announced, get tickets and plan the diet accordingly.  This has to be one of the more unique dining experiences the already vibrant Vegas' dining scene provides.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ZP6qFq7LUh6Tr7WHPoOW6g"}

And sure enough, we arrive and wait in the tiny entry way for at least 10 min before being approached by anyone. In that time, a friend who had arrived early and staked out at the bar informed me that as soon as she sat down, she was told that she couldn't order food because the kitchen was temporarily shut down because they were too busy. At the time we arrived it was maybe 30 percent full, and she assured me that that had happened 30-40 minutes ago, so they should be back on track by now. \nThe host finally showed up and said she could seat us, but it would be a while before the server would take our order bc they were \"recovering.\" Well, that's better than 10 people blocking an entryway, so I'm not sure why she seemed hesitant to seat us, even if we had to wait for a server. She assured us that we could order drinks from our table until the kitchen was \"ready.\"\nIt was only downhill from there. Thankfully, we were a jovial bunch - under any other circumstances this experience would have been disastrous. 15 min to get drink orders, another 15 to get the drinks. Another 20 min later he took our food orders. 30 min later they started coming out, sort of. Seven entrees came out, staggered over a period of five minutes. But three entrees - all pad thai - didn't arrive until at least 10 min later, when everyone else was finished. I understand not everyone can get food at exactly the same time with a party of 10, but they didn't even come close, and at the time we made our food orders it was at least an hour if not more after their alleged huge rush that shut down the kitchen. \nI got the peanut chicken - grilled chicken with peanut sauce, rice and grilled veggies. The sauce was too citrus-y for a peanut sauce and too thick (funny that I complained in my first review that my curry was too thin). Chicken underneath was completely flavorless and was dry and veggies were scant. Good thing it was only $10. Didn't get details from anyone else except the BF, who got the Kao Pad Jay, and kept saying over \"I'm so glad I got this!\"\nAll these issues seemed to be circumstantial (except the chicken dish), but, then again, how long has WT been a restaurant? Come on, I'm sure they've dealt with many a Saturday night rush and someone (ahem, manager??) should have at least come out to explain/apologize for their issues.

If you want to get Screwed; Go to Auto Nation Fiat, \nI-17 and Bell Road.... If you DON'T want to get Screwed I'd advise you go to the Fiat Dealer on Elliot off the I-10 Freeway.  Chuck Brewer is the only decent Person on the lot.  FIRST they advertised 8,000 off MSRP.  Every car I looked at I would ask Chuck, \"So Chuck with $8,000 off the car would be this much?\" YEP was Chuck's response... This went on for about 4-5 cars; when I finally found the Little Fiat of my Dreams...... Once at home; going over the paperwork I realized I didn't get 8,000 dollars off I only got 7,000... I called Chuck... Chuck was an agreement that... NO, I was supposed to get 8,000 off.... Called and Spoke to Steve Rogers... Everyday... only to get NO WHERE.... Then I spoke with Scott Valverde (or something sounding like this)... I guess he is the general manager...First Scott said I needed a coupon - That is why I did not get the 8,000 dollars off...- I told him... Every car I asked Chuck about... he told me how much it would be with 8,000 dollars off - Chuck didn't say \"with a coupon.\"  Then it was how come I signed the paperwork - not ONCE but TWICE??? (there was problems on the 1st set of paperwork).  I told Scott and this is a learning experience for all of you: \"I have never went and bought a car and re-added up the finance guys figures!!\" And I have bought a lot of cars.  NOW you guys know to ADD UP their figures.  If someone tells me I get 8,000 dollars off MSRP as a Rebate; I expect them to be Honest and upfront with any rebates I have coming to me.... I live my life as doing the right thing for the right reason; and this dealership has done anything BUT.  The 1,000 dollars I put down on the car, i stopped payment on this Check (I figured we would be even that way).  Now I have been sent to collections; the collection agency calls me several times a day; every day; they call my work.  They call my husband.  THIS CAR Buying Expeirence has been a complete nightmare!!! I would NOT recommend this AutoNation Fiat Dealer; I-17 and Bell Road to ANYONE!

Both my husband and are extremely sensitive to MSG and as I could see no mention of their use or non-use of MSG on the menu and the fact that the hot and sour soup just didn't look right when it arrived I asked and was told that the hot and sour soup did contain MSG but the waiter said he would bring me a bowl of hot and sour soup without MSG - after hearing the kitchen staff yelling at the waiter for bringing back the soup I did not receive a non-MSG soup!    We ordered from the all inclusive lunch menu + an order of their fresh (that's a joke!) spring rolls with tempura shrimp -  they were so rubbery you just couldn't eat them plus they were mostly lettuce and noodles and a tiny little tempura shrimp which was hard to taste) and were also told by the waiter that the peanut sauce he brought with them contained MSG.     The egg rolls which came with the lunch were delivered and we were advised again that they contained MSG - again no alternative/substitute was offered.    The entr\u00e9e was delivered I had Pad Thai Chicken and it looked like the food had been thrown haphazardly on the plate - presentation and flavor poor at best.   My husband had kung pao shrimp and there was lots of zucchini and very little shrimp - again food just thrown on the plate.   Lastly on the entr\u00e9e, before delivering, waiter advised that the ordered fried rice also contained MSG and actually offered an alternative of steamed brown or white rice - we chose brown and noticed on the bill that we were charged an additional $ amount for that, but no credit for all the other items we couldn't eat because of the MSG.  \n\nThe service was just OK, but disappointed with the lack of knowledge of the waiter as far as what did or did not contain MSG.    \n\nThis is a restaurant we will never (and I don't say never too often!) dine at again nor could I ever recommend it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KTF-E3NfkJy2wiwcgOPyVQ"}

Some queue up with their parents outside the ice cream van to get mr Whippys or candyfloss. If people are not playing sports, they are having BBQs. There is a lot of smoke and that familiar smell of sizzling food.

While they don't serve dinner all night long, they do continue serving their most popular tapas until close. \n\nSo grab a group of friends and head over to Radio Maria soon; the availability of food at all hours makes it a great place to start or end a night downtown!", "type": "review", "business_id": "AB5RgQ0ZnMThdqgFS3cPuw"}

On June 29th, we accepted the contract, and agreed to a flexible schedule, which meant dropping the price about a thousand dollars in exchange for pushing the schedule out.\n\nSeptember 18th is when they came out and did the work - 2 and a half months after signing the contract. A long time to wait, but only a little bit longer than the 8-10 weeks their flexibility discount disclosed. The work took less than a day.\n\nLater that evening, I had a close look at some of the work, and found it to be unsatisfactory. The majority of the stamped concrete was ok, with a few exceptions - some chips that were kind of expected with new concrete, and a couple rough patches. The grass seems to be good. However, the planters are absolutely awful. There were lots of cracks, a lousy paint job, a corner that was nowhere near straight, splashed paint everywhere, and it just looked terrible everywhere.\n\nI wanted to give them a fair chance to make it right - if they could fix it, I'd still be happy with the work.\n\nI contacted them that night, and followed up with pictures the next morning. I was told someone would be out in a couple weeks. On 10/5, I followed up, and they were \"behind schedule\", in their queue for the end of October. On 10/26, I followed up again, and was told they were still somehow way behind due to all the rain this year - there was rain, but I don't see how a few days of rain can put you a month behind schedule for taking care of your paying customers.\n\nOn 11/18, I gave them one more chance, clearly stating that I needed someone out there now in order to give them the opportunity to make me a satisfied customer. They called and gave me a scheduled date in mid-January (about 4 months after I first reported their problems). I told them it was absolutely unacceptable, and asked them to inform their general manager of my disapproval. They responded and gave me a date of December 14th, which is 3 weeks from today, and apparently that's the best they can do. Nearly three months (and five and a half months from contract date), that's just not good enough.\n\nBased on my experience, this company does not seem to care about their customers' schedules and they seem to have no concern for customer satisfaction. Regardless of whether or not they clean up their issues when they finally come out, I would not recommend this company.\n\nBTW, all the photos I've attached here were taken the day after the job was completed, and I sent all of them to Sharp, showing them exactly why I was dissatisfied.", "type": "review", "business_id": "g6r8T0nvxlrpJB-khmqntw"}

I came here hoping for something Jimmy. I understand that they can't play all Jimmy all the time, but I was hoping as it was a weeknight to hear some, even if it was a cover band. \n\nOf course being the fan boy that I am, I had to get the Cheeseburger in Paradise. My wife got the filet. (I love a woman that eats steak!). Neither one of us was impressed with our meal. I thought the burger was kind of plain, even with the Heinz 57 on it (I admitted I was a fan boy!).  The burger was kind of dry and not very appetizing. It could have used... something.  My wife said her filet was the same, just kind of eh, okay. Definitely not worth the price we paid for it. \n\nThe part that really killed this place for me was the service. We had the worst server of our vacation here. He was slow, didn't check up on us. Our drinks would go empty and we couldn't get refills. Even when we were finished we had to flag him down to come over to get a check, and then we had to wait to get that even longer. \n\nJimmy, I'm still a fan... but I'm not going back to this Margaritaville again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "iXA8Y2bzvZo8MjALfZxrIg"}

Now I know that I can stop anything being done on my son that I don't believe is necessary. My son was poked more than 10 times from nurses trying to find a vein, by guessing they felt a vein. After all the poking they end up saying \"I guess he doesn't need an IV\". Another nurse forced the foreskin of my son back and told me that since I choose not to circumsize my son that I need to learn to pull my sons foreskin all the way back to clean him. I did more research, because I knew that didn't sound right plus the fact that my sons penis was red for a couple days since she did that to him. She also would speak to the other nurse about how she has more work to do and she was so impatient that a male nurse stepped in and said he would handle some of what she still had to do. Maybe all these nurses were having a bad day, but it was no excuse for treating my son the way they did and for that reason I will not be taking my children here ever again! I went somewhere else for a follow up because my son got worse and I did not agree with their diagnosis. At the other hospital the doctor wanted to admit my son because he was afraid my son would tire himself out and stop breathing! Unfortunately they said he would be transported back to Children's.

Most people, in Arizona, automatically think of lumber liquidators when searching for floors. I decided to look for other suppliers and ultimately chose Arizona Floors for my project.

I brought this up to Ryan Jackson and he contacted his boss and honored the original quote I verbally received a month before From him. I highly appreciate a company who stands by their word!\n\n3-Ryan stopped what he was doing, and immediately gave me his full attention. We found the flooring I needed, discussed installation techniques, and even gave me a few examples of durability by explaining a few local business that have had the same flooring installed in them for years and how their flooring has held up over time.\n\n4-This is a locally owned and operated business, these guys care about the products they offer, and most everything they carried looked of very high quality. They've taken the guess work out of finding a quality lasting product. \n\nI am satisfied with my transaction, customer service, and ordering process... Now let's hope the install goes well and the flooring holds up!\n\nThanks AZ Floors!", "type": "review", "business_id": "JZUsDqSUwf7p3rJyIIHkbg"}

We don't usually go for the extended warranty but on a purchase of this price range, he let agreed to the extended warranty.  I would say it's a good thing we did because a few weeks ago our TV decided to have a bright blue vertical line in the picture.  Tried calling the customer service number at Frys for the warranty for a week.  When he did speak with someone he was told that someone would have to be getting back to him.  They never did.  He finally went to Frys in person.  First speaking to one of the folks at the returns desk.  I took a little video of her shrugging her shoulders and saying she didn't know why no one had called back before a manager came over and said \"no photo or video is allowed\".  The manager went on to say that the customer service calls were all routed to a call center in Santa Rosa.\n\nWell, obviously the call center in Santa Rosa is a dead end zone.  The in store customer service guy was able to get someone on the phone who did schedule one of their local contractors to come out and evaluate the TV.  The guys who came out seemed experienced and said the problem is the main board.  Too bad the customer service folks at Frys aren't as good as their independent contractors.  \n\nAfter hearing nothing for a few days, we got in touch with the contractors.  They said Frys had denied the repairs because it would be cheaper to replace the TV.  So we began trying to find out when and how they're going to replace it.  We cannot get anyone to communicate with us regarding this issue.  Yesterday when the hubby stopped by the store, the customer service guy was put on hold for ten minutes and finally someone got back to him that they would be in touch with us.\n\nThis is the WORST customer service I have ever seen.  Trust me, do not shop at FRYS Electronics for any big ticket items.  I would not give them even one star if Yelp would allow it.  The final insult is they sell their extended warranties based on the idea that if something breaks down they'll fix it there and/or bring it in and get it replaced.

It actually introduce me to Greek food in the first place which I have since expanded my horizons to some really wonderful mom and pop Greek restaurants. But I would still frequent Daphne's when I wanted to satisfy my Greek food craving in a pinch. Their convenient locations and fast service made it ideal when I just wanted to pick up some Greek food and head home. \n\nHowever, times are a-changin' and it seems to be extremely obvious at Daphne's nowadays. My go to meal here was the shrimp & gyro combo plate. It always hit the spot with a little bit of everything. But lately, my combo has become a little less satisfying. The tzatziki sauce is now super runny/watery when it used to be perfectly creamy/yogurty. The rice is less flavorful and less fluffy than it used to be. The gyro meat seems to be more on the dry side and the breaded shrimp aren't so breaded anymore. Even the pita bread seems smaller and thinner. I don't know if these things were simply bad experiences for me or if they are, in fact, changes that were put in place to battle the trying economic times. Whatever the reason, it just isn't quite the same anymore. At one point in time I wouldn't have batted an eyelash at spending $12-14 for my quick Greek food fix but lately the plates that are being served just don't seem worth it anymore.\n\nIt's not always feasible to go to a sit down Greek restaurant because sometimes I just don't have the time or finances so I really hope that Daphne's will one day be restored to glory in my books.", "type": "review", "business_id": "t4pkeGscooStLjy-Js5Byw"}

The restaurant thrives on it's mastery of adding unique twists to traditional Vietnamese dishes to create quality, specialty dishes.\n\nRice Paper's menu offers an array of delicious noshes catering to all eaters, carnivores and vegans alike. The house-turned-restaurant offers comfortable seating outside at lounges and long tables or at high tops and tables inside. The restaurant is fairly small and dimly lit for a trendy, modern feel. It is a perfect place for a romantic date or group dinner party.\n\nStart off the night with one of Rice Paper's signature cocktails with lychee-infused vodka or a seasonal craft beer on tap. Pair drinks with one or two of the 17 different types of spring rolls, deep-fried or wrapped in rice paper. Meat lovers will also love the crispy chicken wings battered in a fish sauce reduction for an appetizer.\n\nThe main course is the real deal. Bypass the banh mi sandwich (Vietnamese style cold cuts served in French baguettes) and Pho (traditional Vietnamese broth with vegetables and meatt) and go straight for the good stuff. \n\nOrder the firecracker shrimp from the appetizer menu and the garlic noodles from the side dishes. The server will know exactly what you are talking about and will combine the two upon request.\n\nDon't let the \"appetizer\" and \"side dish\" titles confuse you, this is a large portion of food that will leave you feeling fully satisfied. Smaller appetites should consider splitting this dish and getting a couple of spring rolls along side.\n\nThe firecracker shrimp and garlic noodles combo has become my Rice Paper creed and to be frank, there is just no point in going to the restaurant and not ordering these two dishes. \n\nThe shrimp is plump and juicy on the inside, while the crackling battered skin on the outside offers the most satisfying crunch when you bite into it. It is covered in a delicious, tangy, creamy sauce with a sprinkling of black and white sesame seeds. Then, the shrimp is topped off with a boost of slivers of iceberg lettuce to give it that extra freshness and crunch.\n\nThis dish, combined with the garlic noodles is absolutely divine. The thinly tangled noodles ooze with a buttery warmth and garlicky goodness. Swivel the noodles up with your chopsticks and pick up a shrimp to assemble the perfect bite. \n\nLet your taste buds tingle with excitement as they take in foodie sensation heaven, exactly what you've been wanting and the perfect way to end the week. Wait about 20-30 seconds before you take your next bite to really savor the moment. \n\nAdditional Details: Parking can be limiting so consider carpooling if you plan to go with a big party.

The music was at a decent level, but for some reason, the place is just REALLY loud. \n\nAnd finally, and this is just a matter of personal preference, I'm not a fan of the seating arrangement.

Server came back and I ordered an Redd's Apple with Fireball shot (25 oz) and my boyfriend ordered a beer. Another server or manager came over and checked on us. She was very friendly. We also ordered the medium chicken fingers with sweet potato fries. It was pretty good & yummy. I enjoyed my beer. It was recommended by a friend. The cinnamon from the fireball shot kind of made my Apple cider taste a \"little\" like Apple pie. \n\nAnyway, we received great service. They were very attentive and friendly. Also chatted with us. Plus the food came pretty quick. So that was good because I wanted to eat while I drank. \n\nThe atmosphere was cool. Not smokey in there at all or anything & had nice decor and lighting. Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves there. I think there was also a birthday party going on in the lounge area. They also have pool tables & gaming machines in there.", "type": "review", "business_id": "K8b-PV0Lo_Z0KylMI6wkhQ"}

We had lovely conversations with the 2 staff/bartenders that were there the day we were.  Both were funny, knowledgable, and friendly.\n\nI ordered a couple of things as I was starving...hummus, and some sort of salad.  The salad was a salad and the hummus was sooooo good!!!  We had a couple of drinks and then went on with our sight seeing.\n\nThe Melville Bar is just a couple of blocks in the opposite direction of where most of the tourist sites are, but definitely worth the extra time and energy!

Be sure to request a table inside the tree house...it's where all the cool kids sit. \n\nMastro's is not cheap, but then again, nothing in Vegas is.  In any case, it's worth every penny because the food is outstanding.  I started off with a very rich and tasty New England Clam Chowder.  For my entree, I went with the porcini mushroom crusted sea bass with fried spinach.  It was light but delicious!! Perfect for lunch.  For the side dish, what else but the lobster mashed potatoes! I'm not talking about lobster flavored mashed potatoes.  No, no, not at Mastro's.  I'm talking about over a pound of lobster mixed in the mashed potatoes.  It was soooo good and was big enough that all four of us could enjoy it with plenty to spare.  Although we were happily stuffed, our waiter brought out their signature butter cake with fresh whipped cream on the side for dessert; with his compliments (a very nice touch, which only further highlighted the tremendous service that we had during our entire meal). I highly recommend getting this dessert no matter how full you are. We all loved it.\n\nI should note that the cocktails were also great.  Make sure you get one of their signature martinis, which comes with dry ice on the bottom of the glass that makes the drink bubble and emit smoke.  Pretty cool. \n\nAlthough I was able to get a table for four for lunch on a Saturday with ease through OpenTable, that won't last long because the restaurant only opened up 2 weeks ago and the buzz is still building.

From ages 2 to 5 months, you can bring your baby to a free weekly swim class. It's probably more for you than for them at first. The baby gets the early experience of being in the water. The parent gains of confidence of being able to properly hold and play with their child when they take them into the water. My daughter not only took to it pretty quickly, but going to Hubbard on Wednesday afternoons probably became the highlight of our week during the three month session.\n\nThe instructors were awesome and we were never pressured into signing up for paid classes. The social aspect (with the exception of a couple of times where we were the only ones who showed up) is also quite fun. It was nice to meet other parents with children that were my daughter's age. It's always warm in the pool area, and there is a separate pool for the babies with water that is kept to a pretty high temperature. Just do your best to make sure your child (and you) don't swallow the water. Just trust me on that one.\n\nWhile we didn't sign up for more lessons (I have a backyard pool that we spent a lot of time in over the summer), I definitely credit Hubbard with why my child's love for the bath and pool, and pretty much everything else that involves water. She even enjoys being dunked and having water poured over her head. How many people can saw that about their baby?\n\nNow that the weather is cooling off, and I'd love it if my daughter could start learning the actual fundamentals of swimming (at least for safety), more classes could be in order.", "type": "review", "business_id": "kk85ivM6MQUtH8u642p1Ew"}

Much better than expected, actually.\n\nAll the desserts were shared and devoured in record time, with extras left over and packed into the freezer for later. Portions are huge and well priced: $3.50 for a small that is easily 1.5 pints of a regular dessert portion. \n\nService was fairly good too- only two employees but both were super sweet, working together to get orders out and make sure customers were satisfied.

While the decor of the restaurant and the location were not my favorite, I could understand that the restaurant was aiming for a \"classic\" vibe. \n\nSince we had a $50 Groupon, and it was just the two of us, we had to go a little bit crazy. We ordered the garlic fries, the mac and cheese, and baked salsiccia, and a cast iron pizza. The fries were awesome, which you would not expect of an Italian restaurant. The weren't too garlicky, which is definitely a common theme in flavored fries. They also weren't crunchy. I like my fries softer, so this was perfect. \n\nThe mac and cheese was fantastic -- al dente and overwhelmingly cheesy. I would not hesitate to order this again. \n\nThe baked salsiccia was my least favorite of the dishes. It didn't have enough flavor for me, but I also don't eat sausage. My dining companion said the sausage cased in house was great. I would still pass on this one.\n\nThe cast iron pizza was a huge hit. Not too saucy but perfectly thick, cheesy, and salty. At $25, I am not sure that I would come here to get it at full price, but I was extremely happy with it. Our carb overload left me happy as a clam.\n\nThe service was also excellent. The waiter/bartender was always helpful, informative, and passionate. He made the experience even better. The restaurant was not busy, and I hear that it doesn't get super busy, but I wish more people knew about it. It blows Pizza Rock out of the water.", "type": "review", "business_id": "rPH94boFn2vEpZeVZ_jXnw"}

Parking can be difficult, the crazies roam around-- deal with it, they're about to pass out to sleep lol. It was about 9:00am so there was a little bit of a wait, 20 mins for us. \n\nSERVICE: We were greeted by someone who we thought was our sever, turns out she only brought out drinks, ok.

We were greeted with a very bland \"Ready to order or do you need more time?\", took out order and we rarely saw him after that. Everyone else other than our server was attentive and very nice.\n\nSHRIMP & GRITS: Lacked the flavor that I was looking for. Lola's has their version of Shrimp & Grits that blows this one out of the water. The shrimp was way overcooked, practically rubbery. Grits is flavorless so you have to add things to it to give it some taste and it usually mellows out a dish and takes on the flavor of the sauce that the shrimp is cooked in. Unfortunately, the grits  muted the flavor of the shrimp rendering it to be practically bland and an all around disappointment. \n\nCHICKEN FRIED STEAK: Tasted like it was a few days past its use by date, husband was so disappointed in it.\n\nPASSION FRUIT ICED TEA: The best part of my meal. WTF.\n\nAMBIANCE: Hipster and beyond. This is something that reminds me of what you'd find out in SF or SoCal.

Maybe we're just LA/NYC snobs. We heard Madison was foodie heaven and to try the Merchant. Sorry y'all this is just Applebees with better quality ingredients. The Merchant has all the fixings of a great restaurant but it's execution is, in my eyes, majorly lacking. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I shared the mushroom bisque, blue cheese salad, french fries, and salmon. We orders two of their new summer cocktails. \n\nMushroom bisque was room temperature, I like the whole vegetables in it but it was overall creamy and cold and the bread it was server with was sticky, doughy, and cheesy for a baguette. Sour cream dollop on top was not needed. \n\nBlue cheese salad was horrendous. The blue cheese was fantastic and fresh, so were all the ingredients, but it was practically a slaw there was so much dressing. I couldn't finish it, and by the end the blue cheese had all smushed into the salad so it was more of a paste than a slaw. If the ingredients are so good, let them speak for themselves not all yell together. My stomach hurts. \n\nThe fresh fries were delicious, a bit over salted but whatever. \n\nThe salad with the salmon was great, the salmon itself was. . . cooked poorly, half dried and burned on the outside, raw on the inside, never seen anything like it, and I know why. \n\nThe drinks were the saddest part because of all the hype around the cocktails and their special elixirs. Given that they said these were new drinks and they were open to feedback. But, (1) straws should very rarely be served with a nice cocktail. Stirring straws, okay, big sippy straws, naw, it's not a soda. (2) Ice, too much, too cold, again, not a soda (3) drink itself, just bland, too sweet just tasted like a standard mixed drink, or sub-standard, something I'd get handed at a frat party. \n\nGah, sorry, really wanted to like it. Service was great. Ambience was mostly nice except for the ugly floral pattern on the columns and the sub-par chalk work above the bar. \n\nGreat intentions but the foodchefs and the barchefs could use a revamping.

This is a warning! We went one about a month ago and the owner's wife drunk as hell and start's yelling at my wife check this out through the cracks of the bathroom stall telling her not to use all her toilet paper. So we decided we wouldn't go there again, then again we decide it's very dirt cheap so lets go back well last night we did what dumb mistake! We start there with an old crappy band, and then decide lets play pool put 75 cents in the machine, one ball is missing, can't play with one ball missing so we decide oh well lets just play take away the other color ball, we start playing and all the balls got stuck, and the pool sticks had no tips we had to share a stick. When we decided to complain that we couldn't play anymore because the table was broken 1st she decides to say it's not broken I just got this fixed.....well we didn't break it so idiot someone did. While she's away one of my friends decided to get the balls off the table and \"punches the balls\" she comes out yelling it costed her $600 to get it fixed and was making a big deal over the balls even though thats the whole point your supposed to hit the balls....with a crappy stick! She yells at my friends then comes to me and my wife even though were no where near her and starts yelling at my wife through me. She says everytime you guys come here theres a problem....and includes when you left last time you left trash...oh I'm sorry forgot this was a prissy bar where the owner is LAZY doesn't want to do her job or pay for it.....but she can \"FIX\" a pool table. I said what? and she keeps going then decides to call me a drunk....when she's the worse person in the whole bar, and I was the D.D. how the hell was I drunk? Then she keeps going when I'm clearly ignoring her so finally I asked why she was still talking to shut up and she said don't tell me to shut up. I told her it's okay you just lost $100+ a night from us so thats fine you'll never see us again so she decides because were leaving to say you guys are 86'ed really? Because your drunk ass can't handle the sitiuation. She ruin's everyone's night even the person that is not saying anything.....She's an old lesbian even though she claimed she's been faithful for 4 years and then asked my wife if she's jealous that she's making out with other woman on the pool tables....that she's mad about I mind you....but she's \"faithful\" my ass!

We booked this hotel through a travel agency, and we did get a lot of discount. Because we paid much less than the regular price, we weren't really expecting the nicest room. However, we did ask the girl at the front desk if we could get the highest and quietest room possible. She replied that we already had the highest and quietest room available. It was nice to hear because we were ready to tip her $20 for upgrading our room. (We heard about the trick..but we didn't end up trying it). \n\nThere are I think 63 floors total, and we stayed at the panoramic room on the 62nd floor. The windows were toward the other side of the strip, but we still got a nice view, and the floor was definitely quiet compared to the lower floors. The bathroom is roomy and clean, with all the necessary amenities for free. The room itself is extra spacious and their bed is SUPER comfortable. Their pillows feel like heaven. I almost wanted to purchase them if I could, and I think you could if you ask. \nThere was a minibar in our room that had small bottles of alcohol and soda cans. Be  cautious- they cost maybe 5 times the regular price outside, but if you feel lazy or too thirsty, go for it.. just remember the 60 second rule, if you remove a certain merchandize(candy, soda.. etc) for more than 60 seconds, they will automatically charge them under your room number.\n\nTheir Casino is very modern and clean. We were mostly playing at the Wynn Casino, so I can't really review on the Casino here at Encore- I bet they're close to the same. Just by glancing, there were more tables over at the Wynn, and that's where most people play. The check out was smooth, gave us plenty of time to get up and pack our luggage..

The crust was really nice, chewy, with that delicious wood-fired smokiness. The sauce was simply crushed San Marzano tomatoes that had a wonderful, sweet flavor. I opted for a pizza with buffalo mozzarella, which had a little sharper taste than the cow's milk cheese. \n\nMy brother tried one of the Pizze Frite, fried pizzas, which was kind of like a deep fried calzone, or a giant fried ravioli. It was OK, but I know he was glad to sample some of the other pizzas we ordered. \n\nI would like to eat Pomo again. Next time, I'm dining in.

After seeing so many positive reviews I headed over during my lunch hour. The owner took a personal phone call and continued on the call the entire time I was there. I briefly asked if he could replace the zipper. He charged me $25 during his conversation on the phone and told me to pick it up the next day. \n\nFast forward to the next day: there was a sign on the door that said \"Closed\" and then \"go next door\". So, I walked in to a barber shop. The woman nearest the door interrupted a haircut and headed over with me. \n\nI handed her my ticket. She looked at it briefly and asked me for a description of the item. She proceeded to dig through the back room. Came out holding a wallet. Nope. That happened again. Then she called me back and asked me which of the purses and wallets on display was mine. None of them. Then she noticed my wallet was in a huge pile of other items on the repair table, still unrepaired.\n\nAwesome. \n\nThe next day I arrived to pick up my item. It had been hurredly put together with a zipper that was inappropriate for the weight of the wallet, was very hard to zip/unzip, there were plenty of gaps where it wasn't sewn correctly and wasn't the same color as the original brown zipper. I explained the problems, told him I would be happy to take it somewhere else if he would like to refund my money but he insisted he redo it. \n\nI decided to give him a few days before heading back and they had someone new manning the front desk. There are still gaps where the zipper isn't fully sewn to the edge of the wallet, an added bonus of several layers of knotted upholstery thread on the wallet edge and a black zipper.

Since our plans for this trip included Journey at the Hard Rock and Ka at MGM Grand we went back to the HRH Tower King Suite. \n\nI'm 6'8\" so a big tub is a big plus in my book, in fact, it's exactly why we got this room again. Imagine my surprise when we checked in to the room and found a lousy 'standard' tub. Odd, since their web site explicitly states: Each 701 square foot king room includes .. with cast iron \"Tea for Two\" tub' .. nope. After spending far too long on hold we were promised the *right* room for our 2nd night. It was busy, I get it, you take what you can get. We followed up in person with the HRH Tower guest services people that we're not looking for an upgrade, just the 'tea for two' tub that was advertised. \n\nThe next day we picked up the keys for our new room in the Casino Tower. A lovely room, although a bit loud since it's 'pool view' .. with a *terrible* 'shower / bathtub combo' deal.  Seriously ? Did you not *just* promise us the room we booked with the bath tub we *explicitly* asked for ?\n\nAfter more time on hold and dealing with a front desk manager who didn't know the difference between a standard King Suite and an ADA Accessible King Suite we finally got the keys to another room in the HRH Tower, with the advertised 'Tea for Two' tub. We probably wasted over an hour in the process but that's how you want to spend your precious weekend off, right ? \n\nPro-Tip and Pet Peeve: you have *two* nice 40\" Sony Bravia LCD TVs. Why can't you correctly set brightness/contrast and get HD content on them ?  \n\nTheir 'commitment to excellence' was lacking in other areas as well I'm afraid. Exposed electronics in the mini-bar, poor service in the taxi line (there are two taxis waiting around the corner, could you maybe call them over?) and generally unacceptable wait times for simple room service orders. Coffee and some eggs shouldn't take over an hour. \n\nRather than risk going through the same ordeal once more I think we'll just go with the MGM Grand Spa suite next time.", "type": "review", "business_id": "kEC7OlpPnZRxCUyVwq7hig"}

The location was ideal because it was right near where the wedding reception was, so it was easy to crash once the festivities were all completed.\n\nI'll try to break down my stay into \"categories\", much like my previous reviews.\n\n1) VALUE: For the money I paid, I could expect better, but wasn't disappointed with what I had. I was in the \"reserved block\" for the wedding, which cost around $105 CAD. It was more expensive than the place I'd found on my own ($94CAD) in the same area, but it was less expensive than the normal hotel rate ($125 CAD), even with a CAA discount ($115 CAD). More details of \"value\" below. 4/5\n\n2) ROOM QUALITY: Decent size for the price. The bathroom (shower/sink) was adequate, the bed was the correct firmness (it felt like it was an older bed - maybe 2007 era?), and the temperature control of the room was quick and useful. The A/C unit was a little loud for my liking, but nothing too far out of the ordinary for a budget hotel chain. 5/5\n\n3) AMENITIES: Oh boy, here comes the low scores. The business centre was \"eh\", the fitness centre was lackluster, and the breakfast was \"okay\" at best. I'm comparing this to budget hotel chains like Holiday Inn Express, and at that level, Hampton falls short. 2/5\n\nOutside of the above experiences, I have to say that this is not a terrible hotel, but for what I'm paying, I expected more. For what I was given, I would pay between $75 CAD and $95 CAD, but no higher. $105 is simply too much.", "type": "review", "business_id": "gwIEhclTvjvy0DWcAm7ifg"}

Pourquoi Pas did, and in a very good way.\n\nIt started with ordering a latte. I was met with a simple question: what kind of milk? The options that followed were not the \"skim, 2%, whole\" that I'd expected, though, but rather, \"house-made almond/coconut, soy, or cow's milk\". Hearing \"lait de vache\" come across, with a slight prickliness to it, caught me off guard. (Of course I know milk comes from cows, but never when ordering a drink does that fact come to my attention.) I stumbled. I fumbled. \"Regular, you know, um, milk.\" Herp de derp, smooth move, Katie. \n\nAfter tripping over my obviously non-vegan beverage order (callous carnivore as I am), I looked at the menu more closely and noticed that cow's milk carries an extra surcharge, and is indicated by a weepy broken heart on the chalkboard. I was tickled by their apparent display of ethics (and judgment?), and determined to try their lait maison the next time, so I could be a cool and compassionate coffee snob, too. I also noticed that their standard coffee was an Aeropress, which gets props from me (I love my home Aeropress), and also noticed the striking lack of other options on the menu. This is, uncontestedly, an espresso bar. A one-trick pony, perhaps, but that one trick is a showstopper.\n\nThe latte set before me -- made with creamy dairy goodness stolen from the mouths of bleating calves at their mothers' teats -- was phenomenal. Perfectly balanced, not bitter in the least, and made with a perfect microfoam swirled into lovely latte art. Mmmmm. \n\nThe next time at Pourquoi Pas, not even a week later, I tried their house almond and coconut milk, and was impressed. It made great foam, and had a rich but sweet nutty flavor. But, for all that, even with the added bonus of self-righteousness for not exploiting our bovine friends, I regretted not getting cowmilk. Sweet, delicious, calorific, uncompassionate cow's milk. I'll placate my conscious by imagining that the extra charge goes toward buying the most wonderful, single-origin, free-range, fair-trade, grass-fed, eco-conscious milk from the happiest cows in Quebec.

I believe I have written a review under The Olive Mill itself, but not for this location which is the restaurant site.\n\nThey have made significant improvements and expansions since my last visit.  The changes have opened up the floor and made it much easier to move around in the crowds.  \n\nThe restaurant is a walk up and order type of place.  They do offer beer, wines, champagne.  Very nice little location for breakfast and lunches.  They also offering pizza nights, live music in evenings.  Nice choices of sandwiches along with some side dishes.  I have not had a bad meal yet.   I am disappointed that you have to go to the coffee shop to get your cup of coffee.  (See below.)\n\nAlso offer some very good gelato.  My favorite the Blood Orange. \n\nThere is also a coffee shop in this location.  They offer expanded coffee drinks.  But it is disappointing that you have to stand in this line to get your coffee that you ordered from the other line when you ordered your meal.  They also do not have free refills?? Although a .50 charge for a refill is not bad, the fact that you do not have unlimited coffee when you go for breakfast is unfortunate.  They give you the ability to buy fresh roasted whole bean coffee.  But at the $12.00 per 12 oz bag, that is a little pricey for me!!\n\nHere with family today to visit.  We went for a late breakfast. We all had or shared a portion of the waffle.  Very good.  One had it with bananas, pistachio nuts and whip cream.  Two other classic.  The fresh maple syrup topped it off for me.  I also had the Sicilian Breakfast Sandwich.  It was good, but a little cold.  Overall, this was a very nice breakfast and worth the little higher price that you might have to pay. \n\nI am a little disappointed in The Olive Mill in general.  They offer a very nice selection of fresh, local made olive oils.  Different flavors along with balsamic. Their pricing seems to have increased. I really have to weigh whether the price tag on many of the \"special blend\" oils are worth it.  I have always like that they offer wines from small vineyards.  And they do have nice prices for some of the bottles.  But I am disappointed that they do not offer the free wine tastings, as it was now $10.00 (but they did have an expanded offerings of wines to taste.)\n\nThis is worth the time and visit. Especially for someone out of town that has not been here.\n\n****\nJust an update, I received feedback from The Olive Mill management. I learned that the wine tasting event that they held the weekend I visisted, which there was a charge for, was a special event. I was informed that on other regular weekends, the wine tasting is still free.  And it is these tastings I have experienced some nice, well priced small vineyard wines.", "type": "review", "business_id": "BPN8GzoigZNQHEve5iP-gw"}

I didn't appreciate that.  I then asked for a new tray and she seemed a bit perturbed that I would actually want a clean try to take my food on.  \n\nThe nerve of me, right?

Must have got lucky cause they forgot it on the grill.  Check the pic. It was rare and uneven which is a sure sign the cook either isn't very good or forgot about it. \n\nI give up. Get your heart set on a pleasant experience and your favorite dish at a favorite place and let down to the ground. Sounds like an overreaction but it pisses me off. My bill was 54.86 after they took off the breadsticks, which was appropriate so I give them kudos for that.  I would have at least been happy eating a blueberry muffin from the vending machine at work and saved a lot of money. Sometimes you want to treat yourself.

It was in such a small portion of the parking lot that there was too many people there..they over packed it to be comfortable for the space. It was a bitch fit to go through and since theres the entrance fee (was it like $10?) + all the hiked up food vendors it wasn't stacking to much value either. I was out  fighting for a place to even stand to eat so what I did was order, go in another long line and eat in line a few times as I had no other choice, but even then there were so many people bumping into me that I scratched myself with a fork on my face. We finally got a seat eventually, but it was by the stage and was very loud to be right by the speakers that we got up again to find someplace else. \n\nI didn't do carnival games which I LOVE to do honestly and am good at. I browsed and there was very few in variety and a bit pricey for games and rides. Also at that point, I was unsatisfied with food other than a funnel cake and a italian sausage sandwich which though good I don't think should be like $8-10 (I'm sure they have a bitch of a vendor rate though to pay off)....there was this rotisserie chicken plate that though the chicken was good and the macaroni decent,  the side of rice was spoilt. \n\nI was planning on going to AYCE or Korean BBQ that night. I should have for having spent about $60-$70 ish on both of us to sample foods. Totally worth it in LA where I enjoy myself, here I just felt sad as this is really it when it comes to festivals and this is overhyped. Sadly, it was once good and really fun. My BF told me of a time when he and his family have gone when he was a kid and had a great time. \n\nThis year they moved to SIlverton Casino. I hope that makes a big difference.

And I was so glad at it was just as I remembered it to be: gentile and refined with a sense of tradition and history the moment you walk in.\n\nFirst, how wonderful that they offer free valet parking. I made it known that we were just coming in for desserts and coffee, and they were still happy to park my car for me (note: as many may know, parking is a royal pain in the patootie on a busy Friday night at 8pm in the summer! And nearby lots cost $15 to park in them). \n\nWe were told they could seat is in 30 minutes, so we strolled the old port and Place Jacques Cartier Square, marveling in the business and vibrancy of this great city. Upon returning to the restaurant, we were immediately seated. Tables clothed in white linens, leather-bound dessert menus at our seats. The waitresses were all dressed in period uniforms from the last century. \n\nOh, and the food was divine! My youngest had the epitome of a chocoholic's fantasy: the Chocolate Delight,which was a decadent chocolate mousse-like cake with a crunchy chocolate topping, plated on a gorgeous swirled sauce. She said it was the best dessert she ever had. Meanwhile, my other kid and I shared the Crepe Cerise Jubilee: a thin, delicate crepe with vanilla ice cream with lots of cherries (and some blueberries). This was, hands down, the best dessert I've ever had. Ever. I was in heaven. \n\nMy cappuccino was too strong for me, but my daughters enjoyed their French teas. And how lovely, to get some dark mint chocolate medallions on our table as a complimentary treat. Very lovely gesture.", "type": "review", "business_id": "q0PuwC1Qm46RWHE9tmQuQQ"}

Fianc\u00e9 had the pork bibimbap, which was somehow lacking flavor and the rice, formed into a brick and grilled, had a gluey, compressed texture. He liked his beers, but I was turned off by the wine. First, when I asked the bartender for a suggestion and said my only dislike was Chardonnay, he steered me toward the Chardonnay, which was the most expensive by-the-glass option at $15, saying \"It's not like other Chardonnays\"...ok...gave it a try and it was exactly like other Chardonnays. So I ordered a glass of Pinot at a more reasonable $8 or $9 per glass, and it was tastier but oddly warm. Like room temperature warm. The other bartender said that since they have a tap wine system, the wine just tends to be warmer than if it were in the fridge. Gotcha, but a) you aren't the only restaurant in the country with a tap wine system and yet others still manage to chill their wines properly and b) offering me a glass of ice cubes as a solution was just tacky.

However, if I ever really wanted to figure it out, this is where I would come.\n\nIf you look at my other reviews here, you'd see that I really enjoy my beer.  But I'm branching out and have been trying wine, and this is a place that I quite enjoy.  You'd think that with its location in DC Ranch that the prices would be off the charts, but I was quite surprised that it was relatively affordable.  They've got more wine to choose from that I could pronounce, and lots of different varieties of my new favorite thing: wine flights.  Since I don't know much about wine, it's nice to try different types to see what suits me.\n\nThe food here is phenomenal.  Their cheese plate actually lets you choose what types of cheese you want, from cheddar to funky smelly cheese that many people think is great but just weirds me out.  The hummus and shrimp cocktail are quite nice too.  From looking at the signage in the place, most nights have some sort of wine special, from half-priced bottles to wine tasting.\n\nThe atmosphere here is typical Scottsdale.  You have you cougars, your retired rich folks, your $30K-millionaires, and your normal folks (like me).  They have high-top bar tables and super comfortable couches, along with areas tailor made for groups.  Sitting out on the patio is nice too.  The servers that I have come in contact with have been very attentive and very knowledgeable about the various types of wine.", "type": "review", "business_id": "YQ19y3LYgmAHfgNFa01vyA"}

We sat outside and every time someone opened the front door, I found myself inching closer and closer to capture the amazing aromas coming from the kitchen....cardamom, garlic, cinnamon, ginger. \n\nThey had an extensive selection of veg and non-veg options. I got the momocha (vegetable momo) which were filled with some tasty spicy peanut concoction. I was so excited to see Momo on the menu as the only other time I have ever had them was in the Himalayas. \n\nThere seemed to be only one server for all of the indoor and outdoor tables, but she did not seem overwhelmed. In fact, she had an aura of peacefulness about her that rubbed off on us and gave us more patience ourselves.

I seriously was in LOVE when I first came to check out the place! The scenery is amazing. Especially during the sunsetting hours. Which is the number one reason why I chose this location as my venue!\n\nInitially, I have to say I was not pleased with the service I was getting. Especially with the old wedding coordinator, Keri, that was there. She never responded to our messages ever! Hoevere, the new coordinators Kristin and Brittany are AMAZING. Kristen especially! She was pregnant and almost due, yet she was so quick to respond and make sure our wedding day would be perfect! Seriously, I would email a question and within 24 hours I would receive a response! That's quick service! \n\nAlso, the wedding packages are definitely very very very affordable! I was on a budget since I was paying for most of the wedding myself. Kristen definitely helped us with our budget and made sure everything we wanted was set perfectly. The food at the venue was amazing. The chef was very accommodating when we were trying out the foods and asking about food allergies. Yes, there is gluten free items available! And the cake company they work with (Cravin Cakes) is amazing. \n\nFast forward to the day before our wedding. Rehearsal was smooth and they sent email reminders and phone messages to remind us the time and if there were changes. Day of the wedding. Service is great. Everyone made sure we were okay and everything was going well. One complaint I did have was the cake serving. The cake slices were like slivers... almost nonexistent. And some of my guests didn't get served cake because they weren't at their seat. We addressed it to Kristin after the wedding by email and she emailed back and apologized. \n\nOverall, I am very impressed with Canyon Gate as a venue. I do recommend working with Kristin! And Canyon Gate is just gorgeous! Especially the entrance of Canyon Gate is amazing. There are waterfalls right before the main entrance.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tQjSboNMm00GPHbaMvMjlQ"}

The curtains were open at first and it was a bit awkward when people would walk by and stare so we decided to ask the waiter to close them.

Our waiter informed us that their steaks are cooked a little raw so their medium rare is rare, medium is medium rare.. etc.  I'm a person who believes anything above medium ruins the steak but I know I know we all have our preferences.  Anyways, they bring the steak to the table and carve the entire piece for you.  Everything is PACKED with flavor because of the amazingly marbled cut.  I was trying to convince myself that Ruth's Chris was still the best rib eye I have ever had but sadly I think I have a new BEST.  It's sad because they only have this in Vegas ! All in all, don't come here without trying the rib eye.\n\nBeef Cheek Ravioli- AMAZING, this was their specialty pasta for the day.  For those of you that do not know what beef taste like.. the flavor is packed because its a fatty area and very soft texture. Just plain buttery goodness!  \n\nThe sides- Honestly I was took focused on my steak to even think about it.

Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd, Scottsdale, AZ) aims to please with a menu diverse in selection. Tinted windows, location inside a small strip mall on N. Frank Lloyd Wright makes for an unassuming establishment.  Upon entering, you are welcomed into a simple environment with a menu where one can find everything from traditional Italian pasta dishes to dishes with veal or seafood. \n\nTheir traditional garden salad is a generous portion of lettuce, a sprinkle of tomato, and cucumbers served with your choice of ranch, blue cheese or house vinaigrette dressing ($3.95).   You receive a large portion of salad for this unbeatable price.  The house vinaigrette in particular, is light and coats every inch of the salad with taste.\n\nFor the main course, the \"chicken parmesana\" ($14.95) as spelled on their menu, takes a different twist.  Instead of a coated breaded chicken breast, theirs is simply a grilled chicken breast covered with a thick covering of mozzarella and mild marinara sauce.  Along with this dish, a serving of spaghetti with marinara sauce give the pasta compliment to this dish.  There is no lack of mozzarella cheese on this dish; every bite brings a delicious taste to any cheese lover. \n\nFor dessert, their homemade chocolate chip cannoli ($5.95) is not to be missed.  A savory pastry shell is filled with traditional cannoli style cream, topped with many chocolate chips.  It is a most filling dessert; their cannoli can easily be split between two individuals.\n\nWith a simple atmosphere, Nick's simply focuses on what is most important - the food.  With a menu with many selections to choose from and delectable dishes, you can find a hearty Italian specialty easily at Nick's Italian Restaurant.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2RusLQcgpQ2BajF_1zevKg"}

Yelpers are the toughest critics out there. The fact remains is David Copperfield is the best magician of all time. Period. Does he go through the motions like so many other reviews state? I guess I never saw David when he was younger, but it certainly didn't seem that way to me. Negative reviews about the theatre are just silly, it hurts the score of the show. The venue isn't bad it's a typical Vegas showroom. Get there early or you won't get served though and aim for a spot somewhere in the middle if you'd like to be involved in the show ( I was in two acts in one night). They throw out giant balls to prove the volunteers aren't staged (they aren't) and the best likelihood of catching one is by sitting in the middle. My girlfriend was involved in the final act-- which will blow your mind (making a handful of audience members disappear). The Internet is wild with rumors on how this one is done, but no one has the truth and hopefully no one ever will. David is an incredibly charismatic man and a genius in the craft. His charity work and his collection of magic make me envy this guy. He's still a good looking guy and you won't find a more mind blowing experience anywhere. Has he lost his edge? No. There is a reason he is the highest selling solo artist of all time- because he is the king of magic. Half off tickets can be found at Tix 4 Tonight, I bought mine full price. If you've never seen Copperfield, do not miss this opportunity. Like the ones who can say they saw Ruth play, or saw The Beatles play, you will be able to say \"I saw David Copperfield\" and in 50 years- that will be a pretty special thing.

If my kids were slightly younger, I would be able to give it 5 stars.\n\nThe goods: \n\nThe price is amazing.  $12 for as long as they want to bounce.  Here is some comparisons for you: $10 for open bounce at Bounce U, limited to 2 hours, $26 for 90 minutes at Skyzone, and $20 for two hours at Gravady.  No question that Bouncy World is the best priced.\n\nLocation, location, location.  On Stephanie, just north of American Pacific in Henderson.  (Which is only slightly north of I215.)  For me, this is very close to my house.  Ample parking.\n\nFood and beverage sales.  I didn't try the food, however, it makes this place more like CEC rather than the bounce/jump places.  You can come here, order a pizza, baked chicken strips, of just have some treats, while your kids bounce.  Even better?  Unlimited refills on drinks.\n\nAdult comfort.  Three couches and a big screen TV.  There is just no comparison to the hard benches at Bounce U.  Also, ample comfortable chairs, even a few foot stools to kick your feet up.\n\nFour video games on flat screens.  Not an arcade game, so no additional money involved.  Other than food, once you pay for your kid to get in, no more money out of pocket.\n\nAdvertised on their website is a parents night out all the time!  Four hours of babysitting for $25 per kid, kids 5-12.  I could see how useful this would have been when my kids were younger.\n\nThe only bad: this place is really geared to kids 3-8.  My 12 year old was giving me a lot of 'tude about being there.  Eventually, he relaxed and started playing tag with a couple of 5-8 year old boys.  Also, I saw a little boy practically sit in his lap as they were playing video games next to each other.  With a certified Red Cross/CPR/First Aid babysitter in my house, I don't need the parents night out.  \n\nI think that I will come back with my third grade Girl Scout Brownies and I think they will have a blast!", "type": "review", "business_id": "B4vyHeqRuHLpBMMFPOs0YQ"}

So light and refreshing, I just add a tiny layer of butter and sprinkle powdered sugar and dip a bite at a time in the sauce it comes with.

Let me tell you, the facial by Diena is AMAAAAAZING!!!! I can not tell you how much of that experience was my favorite part. You can tell she really enjoys her career and she's very gentle. It was so relaxing and calming. Practically falling asleep. The massage table is really comfortable and cushioning. Everything about the facial was just so great. Her technique and pressure, etc... I would go back just for the facial alone. It's just that amazing! \n\nJanet- hot stone massage, was ok. There was a lot of stone rubbing? Literally, really all she did was take a bunch of hot stones and rub it along your body. I feel like there could've been way more hand massaging happening. After being rubbed down by hot stones for about 40 mins, I don't know, call me crazy but feeling a human hand massage your whole body would feel nice after that... And she talked way too much... I wanna relax during a massage. I don't want to think and have to answer mundane questions. Also she had this weird heated water pad thing on the table which would slosh around with you when you moved and it was kinda annoying. And one more thing, the massage table, definitely small, I'm 5'6 size small/medium, one of my arms was practically hanging off the table while placed at my side, she could use an upgrade and get a bigger massage table, just sayin'... \n\nThan there was Michelle? My mani-pedi lady. She was alright. Kind of rough around the edges. Definitely don't want HER WAITING ON YOU even if your early to your mani-pedi because she'll definitely let you know if she thinks you're late, even when you're not. \n\nI'm really giving this place a 4 star because of Diena.

Place itself is pretty small - kinda weird shaped bar with a few seats here and there around it. There are also a bunch of tables filling up the rest of the bar. Atmosphere is homey, neighborhood bar kind of feel. A friend and I had a few Longboard pints as we spoke of this, that, and the other thing. On the way to the bathroom there's one of them Internet Jukeboxes/TouchTunes thingies on the wall. Men's bathroom has a swinging saloon door to get to the stall. Place wasn't crowded at all so we just drank and chilled. Then all of a sudden there was karaoke going on. Funny thing about this place is we witnessed three levels of karaoke that night. Your lowest level was made up of folks that never sang in school or church or whatever and just figured they could sing because they had a coupla more pints than usual and what the hey - I'm Elvis/Sinatra/Johnny Cash rolled into one! Those folks would be trying to stay on time with the words on the screen and trying to hit all the notes like they were playing some rigged Whack-A-Mole game at the county fair after being suckered by some unscrupulous carny. Pretty much a trainwreck most times - some even made familiar tunes completely unrecognizeable - which takes some genius level atonal compositional skills. Then there were the regular folks that could more or less sing at an amateur level and could carry the tune even if they missed a note here and there - the kind of folks you usually expect at karaoke places. But there were two folks at a third level. I can only describe it as OMGWTF. It was like some professional singers came into to practice a bunch of songs they happened to have on karaoke as a warm-up before either going into the studio or on tour. They had way too much control over their vocal cords to be casual karaoke weekender types. I'd even say they'd proably wipe the floor clean with most Top 40 autotuning dorks. Only problem is - if you're gonna sing your token Elvis song in every key but the one it's playing in, you probably don't wanna follow right after one of them. LOL. Place is in a mall that used to have a Fry's - it recently shut down. There's also an I Sushi & Teppan and Burger King in the same mall at the SE corner of Ray and Rural.

It was time for me to do just that again. My last repair facility I used , was very good for quit a few years, but things there have not been so great lately,  so I searched on \"Yelp\" for a new place. UGH!! So when I finally narrowed it down to Carlife, based on the reviews. I took my car in to the Gilbert location, brakes were not doing so well. After it was inspected, I got the call we all dred, the one that tells you things are worse then you thought. They found items that were in such a bad way, I might have been at risk of steering failing because of bad work done at the place I used to go to. They asked me if I had had work done on this and that recently. I had indeed, They said that things were not done correctly, and now I was in danger when driving my car. I never told them what work I had done, they knew by just looking. They saw the mistakes that were done, and I knew they were right because I was also wondering of the quality of the work the last place did, so Im not surprised, just sad, that the place I had gone for years, was really letting me and my family down. SO....... I asked them if they could do all the repairs that same day, it was a Saturday, and he said he would do his best, {They close at 2:00pm on Saturdays} He said he would do all he could to finish, but if not THEY would provide me a rental car at no cost to me. WOW!!! The rental was not needed, they fixed everything on time. I am really happy with the repairs. I paid more then I had paid in the past at the place I used to go, but I realized, you get what you pay for. I am willing to pay a little more for quality work, and quality parts. Its been over a week since my car was repaired and everything is great. This Saturday, I had them do an alignment on my Ford truck, and change the oil. They also looked over it to see if anything else was in need. They told me my front rotors are a little warped, pads were ok, and I will want to get that repaired in the near future, but for now its ok. I like the honesty!!! I like the professional feel about this place. The place is clean, the shop is big, and looks very neat, I like to see that. I know it's very soon, only been here twice, but I feel like I have found a place that I can trust and feel good about bringing all my cars to. Thanks to everyone at Carlife auto repair of Gilbert!

Great company, delicious food, a fun waitress with a spot of green hair, and a deliciously smooth mule --- what more could a girl possibly want?\n\nLunch was suppose to be at the usual 11:30am but Linh L. and I decided to try to beat Brett B. to the restaurant.  Of course he had thought to arrive at 11:15am too.  Bummer.  One day!  *wags fist*  So after a bit of the usual harassment and a side of bickering about how many seats we should get for our table, we were seated by the charismatic and ever-patient Keary.  This girl is amazebeans!  She was sass and class and had great recommendations for food and booze.  Since everybody's favorite ginger couldn't make it, I love you Melodie C., I got myself an Oh Honey Mule [as per Keary's suggestion] in a shiny copper cup that lasted the whole duration of our two-hour meal.  Seriously, how do we take such long lunches!?  \n\nWhile we were waiting for the rest of the lunch bunch, the sweetie pie Bretters handed out some macarons like the perfect gentleman he is.  Dining with Bretters is a treat in itself but the little after-meal sweets will be treasured.  Thanks, Brett!  He also ordered the table some Hummus Nachos which came out right when the lovely Meghan L. arrived!  After that, it was a whirlwind of laughter, cheer, and a lot of foodie pictures being taken.  Those Hummus Nachos though... oh man!  The deliciously crisp pita with a soft chewy middle with a generous scoop of hummus, a splash of balsamic sauce, and topped with red onions, pomegranate seeds, and feta was a delicious bite!  I could just order two of those platters myself and eat it as a meal.  But hey, we're sensible adults so we're going to have a sensible lunch!  Brett, Meghan, and I had The Brie Hive and Linh had the Malbec Burger.  I didn't try the burger because my sandwich was keeping my tastebuds happy.  The Brie Hive was salty-sweet goodness with prosciutto ham, brie [duh], granny smith apple slices, arugula, garlic aioli, and honey butter in between two grilled pieces of sourdough.  Eating that in between bites of the Salut Fries where the citrus vinaigrette helped cut through the occasional bites of too much saltiness from the ham or too much honey butter richness made for a perfectly balanced meal.  It was a rich sandwich though so I had to box it for later.  It strikes me as something that will be just as amazing right out of the fridge.\n\nOverall I had an extremely satisfying lunch where we were introduced to the assistant manager Nicholas and one of the owners David.  This place really has it all:  Excellent service [thanks again, Keary!], higher-ups that really care about their customers, delicious food, and a great ambiance and vibe.  It's all dark wood, metal accents, and sleek lines. Will definitely be back [especially with the coupon cards for free Hummus Nachos]!", "type": "review", "business_id": "6svqiMcmS-tolyzsz2S4-Q"}

It was a party of six and it was a very busy night between homecoming and it just being a Saturday night.  We were initially told it would be about an hour wait so we headed straight for the bar.  We ordered drinks and within 20-30 minutes our buzzer rand to tell us our table was ready.  We were surprised.\n\nWe sat in the dining room and had a really nice server.  I can't remember her name but she was good and friendly.  We ordered our food and then had salads shortly there after.  A while later, our food came.  All was as it was supposed to be and very good.  We were then informed by the manager who came by to talk to us, that the food took way longer than it should have and that she'd like to give us all dessert.  Here is the thing, we barely noticed, nor did we complain.  We were having great conversation and didn't even notice that it took a while.  I thought that was excellent customer service.  To offer us free desserts without us even making a peep was very nice.  We got our desserts which were all very good as well.\n\nThe food has always been good any time we have been to this Keg.  The steaks are tender and flavorful.  The service has always been good and despite the fact that it took a little longer than usual last night, the service was excellent.  I am a fan of The Keg.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-tBiXT917wKlr6n9wSqViw"}

I'm pretty sure I've tried them all. In the past few months, it seems they've had a kindling of interest in hops, and have made some very nice beers. \nFinally, my wife likes the place and the food, she doesn't care for beer.

I used to go there all the time, but would attribute all of the mistakes/issues to \"new restaurant syndrome\".  After a couple of months of mess ups and bad food I finally stopped going.  After a couple months of staying away, I decided to try again and am still disappointed.  So I'm finally giving up.  I'm a huge DD East Coast fan...but this one has failed.  To echo some of the other comments here are the common issues at this place:\n\n--  Coffee is very inconsistent.  I've never had the same cup of coffee here.  My order is always the same (coffee with cream and sugar), and half the time the coffee is bitter/burned, a quarter of the time they forget the sugar, and the other quarter of the time, it's filled with so many grounds at the bottom.\n--  on the few occasions I've branched out of the coffee with cream thing and gotten a latte or espresso drink, they either tell me \"our machine is being cleaned\" or I get the wrong flavoring.  I usually go at 7:30 AM , so help me understand how during a busy morning time they're cleaning the espresso machine and have it shut down.  Are you kidding me?  This has happened to me more than 5 times.  You'd think they'd clean the machine the night before.  Hmmm?\n-- They are always out of stuff.  One day it's bagels, one day it's eggs, one day it's iced tea.  I thought at first it was the new restaurant thing getting used to quantities, but it's been over a year and it's still not good.\n-- Presentation/packaging is lacking...why are you throwing the iced donuts in a huge paper bag instead of wrapping them in the white wrappers?  As for iced coffee, when i order it, they don't bother to stir in the cream...so all you get is this brown drink with an inch of white cream at the bottom.  Common sense please.\n\nI tried, really did try - but I can't do it anymore.  It's sad because they would have so much more business.", "type": "review", "business_id": "4LRil5Fdz6_3M5QsZYex6w"}

In short THIS PLACE IS FRIGGEN AWESOME!!! \n\nI was able to get a 3 meat platter for $25.00 and stingy is not something that resides in this place's vocabulary. I got more on one plate than I could for $25.00 at the grocery store and when they sat the behemoth of a plate before me I was full before I took a bite. The meat slides off the bone so you will need a fork...and a bib...and a belt extender. The flavor was fantastic from the sauce, to the meat, to the macaroni, to the corn bread, to the napkins, and to the free doughnuts after. The staff is super quick and friendly!

Valet service was quick and efficient, and so was the check-in process.  A couple that was checking in before us asked the clerk if they could upgrade to a suite and were told the hotel was booked to capacity, so upgrades weren't an option.  We later learned that there was a Boyz II Men concert that weekend, so hence the \"booked to capacity\".  \n\nWe got a room on the sixth floor (603) and found out it was quite a walk from the elevators...not a problem, even in our high heels.  The hallway and surrounding decorations were nice, which for some reason surprised me.  Our room, although a bit on the small side, was nicely decorated and felt \"intimate\".  Overall, I was impressed with the hotel itself.  \n\nAs for our two-bed room, we got a rate of $143.10 for the night and with taxes, came to $160.27.  \n\nAfter we got back to the room from a night of clubbing at their in-house nightclub (Airia), we ordered room service, consisting of an order of onion rings and an order of their steak and eggs.  The food came within 20 minutes and was piping hot.  The onion rings (not from FatBurger) were delicious and the steak/eggs were perfect (medium rare and sunnyside up, respectively).  The bill (with an additional $5 tip) came to under $25.  \n\nI would definitely recommend this hotel if I had friends visiting from out of town.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8x9Mzb7gX6SEHQIlSDpU8w"}

We opted for a cheese platter which was massive, the menu indicates it's for two people sharing, however it easily feeds three. Blue, Brie, cheddar and smoked cheese in huge chunks with crusty bread, oat biscuits and some awesome spiced tomato chutney and sweet beetroot chutney. We also had olives, cheese & onion crisps and pickled onions and gherkins. I loved the fact the staff were excellent, asking if we needed more breads or crackers while we enjoyed our food. To go with our meal we had a bottle of house red, a bottle of Malbec and glasses of port. Everything in Pickles was so delightful we ended up staying the whole night instead of moving onto a pub as we'd planned. There's also an outside seated area and dogs are welcome and can get bowls of water and doggy treat biscuits.

A very good Caesar Salad with Creamy Caesar Dressing, very crunchy croutons, fresh Romaine leaves, and small sheets of Mozzarella Cheese was next.\n\nAnd, while Diane enjoyed her Veal Parmigiana with a very tasty and generous supply of Alfredo Sauce spread over the fork-tender meat, accompanied by delicious golden Roasted Potatoes, I savored the 18 small clams that were anchored in a superb light White Wine broth to grace my order of Linguine & Clams.

The restaurant was packed at 7pm, all tables full and about a dozen or so people waiting for tables, it was chaotic but organized.  My only disclaimer is that the review is only for the food, I didn't eat in!  Personally, the service would have to be atrocious for me to downgrade them a star because it was really that good.  I was told that the chef is the one who brought Sichuan cuisine to Pittsburgh, formerly working as the executive chef at China Star in the North Hills and later at Sichuan Gourmet in Squirrel Hill.  I like both of those restaurants, but I feel like I know why I thought they had gone down hill. I also think the fact that its his own restaurant has allowed him to explore his own creativity more.  We ordered the cold beef tendon appetizer,  cumin lamb, braised pork belly, tea smoked duck, and lamb chops.  Everything was delicious, spicy, garlicky, and mouth numbing just like Sichuan food is supposed to be.  I've eaten at Sichuan joints all over NYC, as well as the few local ones we have here, and this is hands down the best i've ever had.  Already organizing a group trip to eat there!

You should probably order more menus if your hostess is not able to provide when she seats a customer.\n\nAfter we ordered, we waited close to an hour for our food to arrive.  Yes, it was a Friday, but hardly \"busy\" in comparison to any other restaurant.  Most people decided that the wait wasn't worth it and left.\n\nThe food when it arrived was below average.  I ordered the burger, which I figured would be quick and hard to mess up.  Unfortunately half the toppings I ordered were missing and I wasn't about to wait another hour for it to be corrected.  My date's pork sandwich was average, but I wouldn't order again if given the opportunity.  The fries were cold.  Other items on the menu sounded more appealing, but for the location and type of restaurant, way too expensive.   $15 for an entree is too high for the area and quality, and I doubt too many people would be willing to order those entrees after waiting 20 minutes before receiving a menu.  Also, $7 for a craft pint is twice the price of anywhere else in the area.    Overall, a 2 hour dining experience not by choice.\n\nUnfortunately, I will not return.  This was the second time I have been to this restaurant and it is the second time I have left disappointed.

Merchant is a hip farm-to-table restaurant that also specializes in mixology. I started with one of their summer cocktails, the Sharknado, a drink made of rum, rum and rum. And some grapefruit juice. The drink was served in a kitschy shark mug which I loved. There is a limit of only 2 Sharknados per customer and for good reason. This drink is strong but refreshing. If rum and shark mugs aren't your thing, there are plenty of other cocktails to try as their drink menu is extensive (60+ pages!). The food is locally sourced and the menu changes seasonally. We had the chance to try a variety of the appetizers and boards. The cheese curds were perfectly fried and the buffalo version was tasty although most of the diners at our table preferred the non-buffalo version. The boards included a variety of cheeses, meats and vegetables. Our server, Kristen, who was excellent, knew all of them. I can't remember any of them...just that they were all good! The house made ricotta on the spring radish and ricotta board was outstanding. I had the steamed mussels for my meal. I was surprised how creamy and light the white wine broth was. Delicious! My husband enjoyed his scallops Proven\u00e7al as well.  The table shared a variety of desserts. I am a huge fan of crime br\u00fbl\u00e9e and Merchant's orange blossom version did not disappoint. The red beet & dark chocolate cake was moist and rich. The dark chocolate & cherry custard was also a hit.

There was a big playoff game so I figured it was a good a time as any. If you like sports, this is a great place to watch the game! While this restaurant has a sports bar atmosphere, it is NOT SMOKY AT ALL and NO SMOKING IS ALLOWED inside. We saw lots of families dining here so it's an a-ok place to bring the kids if you have 'em.\n\nI did love the atmosphere here. The servers all wear team jerseys, or at least they were on the day of my visit. I do not like football but when you are watching a live game surrounded by hoards of cheering fans, it's hard NOT to get into the spirit of things. My husband on the other hand was super happy to be able to keep his eyes glued to the game -- this place has tons of televisions everywhere you look so everybody has a great view. There's even live coverage on the speakers in the restrooms. So if you have someone in your party who loves sports, take them here because if you don't like sports, you can still eat and drink and have a fun time.\n\nUnfortunately, the sports bar atmosphere was the only thing this place had going for it. That and the chicken zingers. The chicken zingers are really fresh, tasty and worth their $10 price tag. They are very thin breast meat chicken strips, breaded and fried before being tossed with your choice of inventive sauces. I'll give Miller's Ale House that, these things are good. \n\nThe service and food was abysmal. Our awkward server was just, well, BIZARRE. We told him it was our first time here and he started almost arguing with me, saying that he knew he had seen me in here before. Um, okay dude, I swear it was my first time here. He also hovered around our booth to the point where we started to have uncomfortable silences. We had some questions about the menu so he answered them and gave way too much information, down to the point where he said \"we don't get too many complaints on that one, but stay away from the fish, I got sick from the mushrooms, etc.\" WTF?\n\nAfter his tremendous vote of confidence, I decided to go with something safe for a sports bar style restaurant -- a bacon cheeseburger. Hubby did the same. Wow, were we way off! The burgers were terrible! I took a bite and said \"this is like a bad version of Carl's Jr.'s six dollar burger.\" More like meatloaf, this overdone piece of ground beef was just plain bad. Both of our burgers were overcooked, flavorless and were obviously comprised of very poor quality ingredients. I opted for veggies as my side instead of fries and they brought me ho-hum frozen green beans. They were an obvious afterthought and were flavorless. Hubby had the side salad and I snuck a bite -- we both agreed this was good. If I ever have to dine here again, I think I'd order the salad topped with the chicken zingers.\n\nWe had to wait forever for refills and our check. The place got packed but even when it was empty our server was bad. The restaurant itself is huge with ample seating both indoors and outside. They have a nice outdoor patio with fire pits. The bar area is huge but some of the tables are long and tall so you'll have to sit on a stool and share with strangers. The dining area has nice, big wooden booths but there's no padding which means a massive amount of \"butt hurt\" if you sit more than an hour. \n\nI'm not really a fan of this place.

They had seemed to done up the place really well and you really wouldn't have imagined it at its location.\n\nIt was pretty interesting as we sat down and literally had to flip through seven pages of the menu and absolutely had no idea what to order. The waiters were definitely honest with their suggestions. Their recommendations turned out to be some of the most unique flavors and tastes I've ever experienced.

Die Speisen die aus der K\u00fcche getragen wurden waren durchweg schon rein optisch ein Leckerbissen. Egal ob Fisch, Fleisch oder Nudelgerichte......ebenfalls die Salate. \nWir hatten Salat und Pizza bestellt und bekamen die Gerichte z\u00fcgig serviert. Die Qualit\u00e4t ( frische Zutaten, leckere Salatso\u00dfe,  toller lockerer Pizzaboden aus dem Holzofen) lie\u00dfen keine W\u00fcnsche offen. Ebenfalls sind die Portionen sehr gro\u00df bemessen und man wird auf alle F\u00e4lle satt. Zwischendurch war immer noch Zeit f\u00fcr die Bedienung um nach dem Rechten zu schauen. Auch der Chef pers\u00f6nlich hat sich nach unserem Wohlbefinden erkundigt. Trotz der kurz aufgekommenen Hektik zwischendurch, aufgrund der vielen G\u00e4ste entging dem Personal nichts, und man verhielt sich stets professionell. Einfach Top !!! Zum Schluss......die Preise sind fair kalkuliert und die Gerichte jeden Cent wert. \nBei entsprechender Witterung kann man sch\u00f6n in den Biergarten sitzen und die Kinder im angrenzenden Spielplatz herumtollen lassen.

Our party bus dropped us off in front and drove away- then we realized that Firehouse was closed for a private event until later that evening....so while someone called the driver to come back, the majority of our party went into Embury to get a drink in the meantime. \n   Now I understand what the vibe is here, and I understand that the drinks are often complex and somewhat time consuming to mix. I also get it that we were \"That Bachelorette Party\" of 20 chicks, including my friend's older, rowdy, Yinzer Aunts. \n    However, the guy bartending was so incredibly rude, it was unreal. I've been in the service industry for over 12 years and I've never seen anything to this caliber. His tone was condescending, the smirk on his face was ridiculous, and he basically told us that since the drinks are specialty cocktails it would take an exorbitant amount of time so we should just leave. Feeling like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman, we did. \n\n  He had the capability to make that situation work in his favor- so think of a quick shot, or an easy drink, or even suggest the MILLER LITE that I see is listed on their menu.

You can pay $1,000 just for a bowl of soup.\n\nThe Chinese mushroom soup with wolfberry was excellent. The broth was rich with umami and had a simple yet sophisticated flavor.\n\nThe Peking duck with Tsar Nicoulai Reserve caviar was very decadent. The duck was traditionally prepared as you would get them in Beijing. The skin was crisp from roasting and separated from the meat. Most of the fat has rendered. They only use the skin, not the meat for the wrap. The skin was wrapped in a traditional crepe, not a bun as bastardized by the Chinese restaurants in America.\n\nThe duck meat was stir fried in XO sauce. Asians love XO sauce. It's made from dried shrimp and dried scallops. Rich in umami goodness.\n\nThis was a very authentic, traditionally prepared Peking duck accented with caviar. Many restaurants use the term \"fusion\" because of laziness. Those restaurants don't want to put in the work of traditional preparation. Not Hakkasan. You can taste the hard work in the quality.\n\nThe braised pork belly was melt in your mouth good. It's prepared Hangzhou style with a little more sweetness than the savory Southern Chinese style.

She pointed out one minor area that she would keep an eye on, but said she wouldn't consider filling at this point.  \n\nBottom line, apparently since I don't have dental insurance, Dr. Shim doesn't have to prove anything to anyone and thought he would try to take advantage of me and unnecessarily drill into 4 of my teeth.

I'm just a regular person who eats food. Sometimes I eat that food in Chicago. Most times I eat it in Portland. But in my 28 years of eating food, I've never eaten pizza that I like better than Papa Del's. The last time I was visiting, I even stuffed a frozen pizza into my checked luggage to take back to Portland, where I threw it in the oven a mere 90 minutes after my plane landed. What I mean to say is: this is special, special pizza.\n\nI'm seeing a lot of complaints about service, but that's missing the point. Does one complain about climbing a mountain to obtain wisdom from the guru at the top? (Actually, I probably would.) Yes, the service is miserable, but that's just part of the journey! There are two seating options to choose from while you wait (and wait, and wait): a sterile, cavernous dining room, or the small bar area, where the jukebox will inevitably be blaring an entire Journey album. Oh, neither of those suits you? Sheesh, why not ask Jesus to tidy up his manger while you're at it? The service has never improved at all during the 10 years I've been eating here, so it's futile to even spend time wishing it would; it's just what you have to deal with if you want the pizza.\n\nThere is this part of the crust where the cheese sort of gets stuffed inside, and it's all gooey and amazing and occasionally I think about it when I'm supposed to be thinking of something else. I start eating each piece with a fork, but about 2/3 of the way up, I always just give in and eat it with my hands so I can best enjoy those precious bites that meld with the crust. The breadsticks are like giant loaves of bread, and you can get them with the pizza sauce or with this nacho cheese that I would normally reject outright, but for some reason it's amazing here. And really, I can only eat two slices, but sometimes I dare myself to go for three, and damn it if it isn't worth the stomach ache every time. What was it I said before? Oh, yes: this is special, special pizza.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zMN8UGd1zDEreT58OCdnyg"}

I work for an insurance company and we decided to have our team building event at The Simple Farm.  We chose the Udder to Table retreat and it was a great experience for all.  We arrived at the farm about the time the sun was starting to come up and were graciously greeted by Lylah, Laurie and Michael.  They had delicious cinnamon rolls, coffee and tea waiting for us in the garden area and even made scrambled eggs for us at the request of one of the people in our group. \n\nAfter breakfast we went to visit the goats and all took turns milking.  Michael and Lylah explained the whole process to us and how they use the milk for their delicious goats milk caramels.  \n\nWe then took a tour of the farm and settled in for our goat cheese workshop from Gretchen.  This was a very hands on experience as we were each able to learn first and then make our own cheese with any mix-ins of our choosing.  There was a lot of sampling and experimenting and the cheese was absolutely delicious.  \n\nWe then took a tour of the garden and the Farmers Market and set out to make our own lunch as a team.  We were split into three groups and given a bowl and some scissors.  We headed out to the garden to pick what we wanted to include in our salad.  We brought back everything we picked and as a group cleaned the veggies and prepared our meal.  Our lunch included homemade pumpkin soup, bread, the salad we had all made together and some goat cheese; it was wonderful.  We all sat at the table and shared what we had learned throughout the day.  The dining area on the farm is absolutely beautiful, I felt like I was in a magazine! \n\nOverall it was a great experience and I would definitely recommend.  The farm is great in itself, but it's truly the people there that really make it an experience to remember.", "type": "review", "business_id": "yDBhFRmDuEwvpE8J6NlkHQ"}

When I do drink it, I want something that's above the cut.  \n\nI came in an noticed the atmosphere first, lots of live plants, and some interesting artwork.  For a long, skinny store, they've made if feel spacious.  It's clean and moderately busy for a Sunday morning on a long holiday weekend. The music is nice, and at reasonable background volume, and with my iPod on, I can tune everyone out if I want.  The lighting here is also great for working on a laptop, not too bright, so I'm not glare blind, but bright enough I don't feel like I'm in a cave.  For those who have selected to read newspapers, there's nice lighting above each of the booths that provides plenty of reading light.\n\nThey were very friendly, and from some of the other people here, I can tell they remember, and care about their regulars.  I decided to try the White Russian Mocha, hot (they do offer it in iced as well.)\n\nI'm a little hungry, but sadly their pastry case had nothing that made me want to buy.  The only thing that stood out in the random assortment of typical muffins and danish was the banana nut bread, but as I'm mildly allergic to bananas, I decided not to risk it.\n\nAs I sit here and sip the coffee, I'm very pleased.  It's great, full flavor, and a nice sweet mocha flavor without being cloying.  When I have a Frappuchino, I always feel as if I'm about to go into diabetic shock and it leaves a weird film in my mouth.  This has none of that.\n\nIn fact, this drink is something I would make for myself at home, if I wasn't so lazy.

We have bought VIP packages for the club in the past and had a great time.  \n\nThe evening started with the VIP limo pick up from our hotel.  The limo was in fact not a limo as advertised but a suburban.  While still a very nice ride, I am over six feet tall so when I hear (or read) limo I think, \"finally, LEG ROOM!\"  The driver, while very chatty, was still quite pleasant.  \n\nWe arrived at the restaurant and were escorted in by the driver (nice touch).  We were seated at a very nice table with VERY comfortable high back chairs.  The dining room is dimly lit but has a rather elegant decor.  \n\nTHE RESTAURANT\n\nOur server introduced herself as CC and took, and remembered, our names.  At first service was very prompt (almost to the point of being immediate) and personal.  About half way though our meal though a bachelor party of ten, already drunk guys showed up who were quit unorganized and demanding.  Girls that work at the club do come into the dining room to talk to patrons and a murder of drunken crows with money in their pockets will attract strippers like flies to a honey pot.  Soon the crowd was up to 15.\n\nCC worked VERY HARD to try and give us the personal service she had before but it was simply impossible.\n\nAs far as the food went... It started with dinner rolls which were superb!  Next a dinner salad that was VERY colorful and well presented and quite tasty.  I had the New York strip and my wife had the Filet Mignon and as per CC's suggestion we shared our sides of garlic mashed potatoes and Asparagus.  \n\nMy steak was good, but it was definitely NOT 5 star worthy as they advertise.  A true 5 star steak house should be serving nothing but USDA Prime and this was choice at best!  (I know meat!).  The g-mashed potatoes were very good and the asparagus was excellent.  We finished with Cheese cake that was first rate.\n\nAt the end CC personally escorted us to our reserved table in the club.  She gave us her card with her cell phone number and a buy one get one free entree for a future visit as an apology for the service.  They may give that discount voucher as part of their standard business but CC sold it as as she did and it was a nice touch.\n\nTHE CLUB\n\nIn the past, my wife and I have come to the club on Sunday or Monday nights. Dressed up as we do and coming in as a couple, we are usually treated like royalty having had our VIP Package upgraded in the past.  \n\nThis time we came in on a Saturday night and it was packed!  We did not receive a whole lot of attention, which is ok, the girls aren't going to make as much money off of us as they will the groups of single guys so I don't hold it against them.\n\nThe place is WELL STAFFED as far as cocktail waitresses go and services was always prompt, accurate and never more than just a glance away.\n\nThere are also a number of \"hosts\"; men in suits (security) that are ever present and keep the place as sane as a strip club can be.  At one point one of the hosts came over and asked my wife if there were any particular girl, or type of girl we might like to spend some time with.  A girl who had caught my wifes eye in the restroom soon appeared at our table.  She immediately commented on meeting my wife in the ladies room and we all started talking.  A little while later we were visited by another attractive young lady who was also a interesting conversationalist.\n\nThis place is expensive, but the service is excellent!  If you can afford it, or can plan for it, I highly recommend an evening at Treasures.", "type": "review", "business_id": "sbPAI0IBqqK54_rg0C_Sxg"}

It was a nice night, but the space was pretty generic and there were open tables in the area we'd asked for, overlooking the bar, so we asked to be moved. \n\nWhen we got to our new table and started perusing the menu, I noticed that the tasting menus weren't there, which I'd read about online. I finally asked about the tasting menu and the waitress said that they don't serve it on the patio, and asked if I'd like to see it. I did, and it was what I ended up ordering (the vegetarian one), but I felt the whole situation was weird and uncomfortable. I just wished the waitress talked a bit more about the food in general. She never talked about what was on the menu, told us about what was good or tried to elaborate beyond the most basic answers to questions we asked. \n\nThe bread server, on the other hand, told us all about the three different bread selections, the type of wheat used in each bread and what made them unique. It was more in line with what I was expecting from the waitress and left me thinking, \"someone needs to give this guy a promotion, stat.\"\n\nThe meal itself was very good. It started with a taste of grilled cheese from the chef, then I had an artichoke soup and mushrooms on toast. I then had a small bowl of fettuccine in an olive sauce, which was a bit too olivey for my tastes, and a delicious grilled mushroom on black rice.

And by \"leaves\" I mean: exceptionally tiny, greenish/white \"leaf-lettes\"from an apparent mini-head of lettuce. Being that Lettuce Wraps are usually eaten by \"wrapping\" the lettuce around the fixings (hence the name), it was a futile experience to attempt to WRAP the baby leaflettes around anything!! \n\nEgg Drop Soup: I should admit that I often drive to Jade Palace on 92nd & Shea JUST for the Egg Drop Soup; it's THAT good! So while the bar was set high, I still thought it achievable. \n\n#1. It's Egg Drop Veggie Soup. Which is fine, if you like a really \"meaty\" spoonful of egg-drop soup - which I do not!  Here's what I found i: beans, pea pods, cucumber, green onion, white onion, carrots, and some lovely mushy tofu. It was LOADED.\n\nHere's what was NOT in the Egg Drop Soup: Anything resembling a lovely, rich egg-drop FLAVOR!\n\nIn conclusion: Two major mis-fires.

It;s also a great place for wedding gifts. I have tons of friends that are registered at Kohls so I am able to buy them a better gift with the discount. If you forget your coupon card, the ladies at the register are great about giving you the discount anyways.", "type": "review", "business_id": "85tkG-7jNZ6pKZo0X-cRWQ"}

She ordered the small and it will last her two lunches in leftovers. I was a bit surprised to see the olives cost an extra $1.50 but other than that she loved it, and I enjoyed it as well.\nI had the home made Gnocchi, which were very good, and very filling. It comes with your choice of sauce, I ordered the four cheese sauce (how could you not) it was excellent, but if I had to do it again I would get a red sauce with it.\n\nPlease go there support them they are worth it.

Tried going here with two of my buddies for a few drinks last night. Was turned away at the door. No flip-flops they say. \n\nFirst they were black leather sandals. \n\nSecond why does this not apply to girls, as we walked away we saw a group head over. One had on flip-flops, we said let's see what happens, they all walked right in. Now these girls weren't dressed slutty, and they were not super model attractive. Normal people. \n\nThird I have been here a few times in the past and they didn't have a dress code. It was a really great place for locals to hang out. Very unique lobby / bar / lounge, with all the paintings on walls and ceiling. It just has that I'm cool atmosphere. Seems its so great though they can afford to choose whose money they want and turn people away. \n\n\nSo if you're looking for a place where you gotta dress the part and look cool, head on over.
