Not to mention, the space boasts private karaoke rooms, which makes it stand out that much more.\n\nEvery day, from 4-7 p.m., all appetizers, house maki, sake bombers, specialty drinks, seasonal wine and sake infusions are half-off. That's a TON of menu items!\n\nDefinitely check out the specialty drinks. There are so many to choose from, and they all tend to be very strong. The last time I went there, I started off with the cutely named Kinky Kooler (usually $9, at happy hour $4.50). It was sooo strong, with Bacardi Dragonberry mixed with fresh kiwi and lime juices and garnished with kiwi, my favorite fruit. It was too strong for me (I'm sort of a wimp when it comes to alcohol), but if you like kiwi, it's an obvious choice.\n\nI tried my friend's Turning Japanese (usually $10, at happy hour $5), which I liked a lot more. It had a very refreshing taste to it, with Stoli Gala Applik, Peach Schnapps and organic apple, pear and lime juices and was garnished with pear slices. I'm sure it was still strong, but the sweetness balanced it out perfectly.\n\nI also had the Hello Kitty (usually $10, at happy hour $5), which you just can't go wrong with. It's a pretty pink cocktail with Skyy Citrus and Japanese strawberry soda and fruit-infused sake, garnished with a strawberry. It tastes delicious, and how could you not order something with as cool a name as that?\n\nI've also had Geisha's sushi before, which I thought was delicious. And you can enjoy all the cheap eats and drinks in a vibrant atmosphere, both for the high-energy ambiance and people who go there. It's your typical Old Town Scottsdale, pretty people crowd, and the bar is bright green with giant pictures of musical icons, connected to a cool patio. Happy hour was packed, so stake out a spot early and get to noshing.", "type": "review", "business_id": "gUt-pPUpOVVhaCFC8-E4yQ"}

There are a few things I really care about when I go to a bar and those are Beer selection, and the food.\n\nThe bar itself is very unassuming, and in a less then desirable area in the shadow of Sam's Town on the east side of Las Vegas.  Inside the bar is dark, with gaming at the bar, and seating at tables around the outside wall.  Several pool tables and a shuffle board in a separate room by the entrance. Overall the appearance of Aces and Ales is very unassuming, and on the surface docent appear to be anything special.\n\nAces and Ales has a rotating Tap list that is never the same twice.  This means you will always have a fresh selection of beers to choose from.  I have yet to find another place in town that has a better beer program.  They also have amazing Tap Takeovers a few times a year with different themes.  This is typically where you will find the \"whale\" beers that you will have a hard time finding else where.  Overall this is the place to go if you are looking for good beer.\n\nBar food is something I truly love.  Simple food like cheeseburgers, fries, and chicken wings are made so poorly at so many places around town.  Aces does all of these things right.  The Eddie Spaghetti is in my opinion the best pizza in town. They make incredible burgers, there fries are always crispy, and there chicken wings are always amazing.  I cannot say enough about the food at Aces and Ales, they have managed to elevate the run of the mill bar food to something really really amazing.\n\nThe worst thing about Aces and Ales is that you have to choose between all of the amazing beers, and food options they have.", "type": "review", "business_id": "MzbPhJboUwkdthdwkpqmiw"}

Each table gets its own heat lamp too, by the way. We started with a bottle of Champagne and the sommelier there was so cool. Loaded with suggestions and just a really friendly dude. We also started with the Mussels and Foie Gras - both equally amazing. The mussels were delicious.. I LOVE mussels, and ever since I left Boston, I haven't had any good ones.. these were awesome. I wanted more. The Foie Gras was obviously delicious..  Prepared to perfection and it was gone in less than 30 seconds. \n\nFor our entrees, I got the lamb and B got the Beef Tenderloin. For our sides we got the Mac n Cheese & Grilled Asparagus. I'm not even kidding when I say that we did not leave ONE bite on our plates. We devoured everything, and all of it was perfect. Especially the bottle of wine we split with it.\n\nTo wrap up the meal, we got the cr\u00e8me brulee to share, and as my photo shows, they personalized it for my special day. That along with 2 glasses of port, and we were good to go.. \n\nStaff don't mess around, they are at your beck and call from the moment you pull up to valet. \n\nI will say this place is not cheap, and seemingly only appropriate for special occasions, however, I will absolutely go back again and again and again, birthday or not.

Prior to that we spotted a man handing out Catfish Alley fliers on the street, he told us to park in the Travelodge parking lot.  When we got there, there was a \"park at your own risk\" sign.  No thanks!\n\nWe walked in and it was cafeteria style.  The man who took our order was pleasant.  Since there were 4 of us we ordered the 12 piece catfish dinner with 2 sides.  My guests were REALLY hungry.  After we ordered, we sat down and our food was brought to us by a lady who looked \"dead behind the eyes\".  She just put our food down.  If we didn't say \"thank you\" to her, she would have not said a word.  Maybe she was having a bad day..  \n\nThe catfish was fillet style and looked kinda thin and flat.  We weren't impressed with the flavor.  It had alot of cornmeal on it with some seasoning.  It didn't have that \"slap yo mama\" taste that I expected since they market themselves as Southern.  The sides were good.  I did like the greens, although it was a taste I have experienced before.  On the way home, I recalled the taste.  It tasted just like \"Glory\" canned greens that you can buy at any grocery store.  I think they just added smoked turkey.  The coleslaw was ok, the mac n cheese was ok, not that nice baked southern style you would expect with a minimum of 3 to 4 cheeses.  The desserts didn't look that appealing in the case.  The cobbler, pecan pie, sock it to me cake and pound cake looked like it had been in there awhile.  I didn't indulge in those, but my friends did.  When they put their fork in them, they looked rather dry.  \n\nThere were only 2 other tables occupied in the restaurant, so it was not busy.

When I went to have it corrected no one knew what to do so it took 2 days for staff to figure out how to fix the situation. I got a $50 gc for waiting 2 hrs while they tried to fix it. I again came back to purchase using my gc and every time I go it it takes over 30 mins to get a smoothie. It's never completely packed. Last week I ordered a Pitaya bowl and the person making it clearly didn't look at the ticket and made an acai tropical bowl. So I asked if they had different products and she said oh I'm sorry I thought it was something else. Took 30 mins. Then a couple ordered and another staff member came from the back sucking on her fingers from eating something in the back, didnt wash her hands just put gloves on and made 2 bowls. Being in the health profession I was highly disgusted. Today I'm on my lunch break and I place my order and the cashier asked if it was ok if it would take 25-30 mins on my smoothie and Pitaya bowl I said no not really why are ticket orders so long and her response was \"Idk that's a good question.\" Mmmm ok if you know this is a constant issue why is it not being addressed. I wasted my whole hour lunch break waiting on a smoothie and a bowl for 45 mins. I just don't understand.  Nothing is being cooked.

Along with husband Gasper we were made to feel like a part of their family with a laid back atmosphere, fantastic Italian food and some of the most reasonable prices I've seen with cooking of this quality. \n\nWhile Maria is busy making sure everything is running smoothly in the dining room, Gasper is manning the open pizza kitchen. Let me tell you, he cranks out some mighty fine pies, no wonder the place is named after him, and they're spot on. Before you even get to taste the pizza your table is graced with a basket of freshly baked focaccia bread slathered in nutty olive oil. Be careful not to eat the whole thing, there is so much to try from pasta to plates all the Italian classics are covered.\n\nThere are two camps when it comes to Toasted Ravioli ($7). Some say that it's a Sicilian Christmas tradition taking ravioli filled with cheese then breaded and deep frying until crisp. While the other camp uses the same preparation, they claim it's strictly a St. Louis invention. Either way we're talking about one tasty belief system. \n\nFried Calamari ($10) is pretty much a mainstay on any menu these days, though few can manage a light fluffy crust while keeping the inside tender and flavorful. A generous squeeze of fresh lemon and a spoonful of marinara sauce and these crispy rings were as good as they get.\n\nI'm not sure who Regina ($15) is, but she must have been pretty awesome to have a pizza like this one named after her. Thin slightly charred crust was crisp on the outside chewy on the inside topped with red sauce and cheese then finished with fresh sliced prosciutto, Parmigianino cheese and arugula. This was the perfect balance of salty cured meat countered by the peppery greens. \n\nAnother favorite the Quattro Formaggi ($13) has the same crust but is covered with mozzarella, fontina, Parmigianino and provolone. The cheeses all played off each other, a milkiness from the mozzarella, a little bit sharp and tangy from the fontina and provolone with a nutty finish from the Parmigianino, its not wine tasting but its certainly has a subtle complexity. \n\nIf you order one pasta dish make sure it's the Fettuccini all Burina ($14). Ribbons of toothsome pasta bathed in a light cream sauce then tossed with prosciutto, mushrooms and basil was simply perfect. My next favorite was the Rigatoni con Ricotta ($12), thick tubes of pasta were the perfect vehicle for the fresh cheese and tomato sauce, heart and comforting.\n\nDon't even get me started about dessert, Maria makes all of them. The Cheesecake ($6.50) was fresh baked that it was still slightly warm. The only time I've had cheesecake like that was when I made it myself and let me tell you what, mine doesn't even compare. If available, be sure to ask about the fresh made Cream Puffs ($6.50). Made with layers of flaky dough then filled with banana or vanilla pastry cream and like the Manno family, they were warm and delightful.\n\nClosed Mondays", "type": "review", "business_id": "t-uJbFctqW2eGtlAIAI60g"}

More importantly, the staff is amazing. Hands down, undoubtedly the best shop and most unique shop I've ever been to. \n\nWhy? I wandered in one day when my usual shop was out of something I needed, and I was treated like an old friend from the moment I walked in the door. Not one, but every member of the staff introduced themselves and treated me like the only customer that had ever walked through their doors. There's something really awesome about an exceptional customer experience like the one I had that day, and it makes for a loyal customer for life. \n\nThe shop has a great vibe. It isn't your standard dark, loud, man-cavey shop. It feels like a bright, cozy living room that just so happens to sell an wide range of quality vaping supplies. \n\nThey carry a diverse selection of mods, atomizers, and accessories. Their selection caters to every \"level\" of vaping, from the vape-virgin to the enthusiast. They have a great line of premium juices and are constantly on the look out for great new lines. Their house juice is super tasty and well-priced, I vape it on the regular. They also have great sales that they advertise on Facebook and Instagram, I suggest you follow them to take advantage of their deals! \n\nI really can't stress this enough though, their customer service is outstanding. Jayme builds like a badass, loves what she does, and is very knowledgeable about vaping. Rainna lives and breathes for the vaping community as a whole and for her customers. They are just wonderful, kind, selfless women. Recently, Rainna moved mountains to order the last few bottles of a discontinued juice from my mom's favorite line. My mom lives in northern Nevada, so I shipped her the bottles that Rainna had ordered and my mom was thrilled. She is coming to town in a few weeks and is so excited to meet the Just Vapin' crew. Customer service doesn't get much better than that folks! \n\nReal quick though, because I feel it should be addressed: For the few unhappy reviewers - I'm really having trouble wrapping my head around the negative reviews, because I've never had a bad experience here.  With that said, if you're unhappy with something, let Rainna or Jayme know and I guarantee they will do everything in their power to make it right. Rather than putting them on blast on Yelp, verbalize your concerns to them directly and they will go above and beyond for you. Allow them the opportunity. \n\nIf you're looking for a new shop, are new to vaping or if you are visiting the area, check this place out. There are a handful of shops my fianc\u00e9 and I could patronize that are closer to our home, but we go out of our way to support Just Vapin'.", "type": "review", "business_id": "EUQeiBgInhw49zFpDscwOg"}

After reading reviews of local veterinary hospitals, I chose Maricopa Wells because they had the best reviews. I am so glad I did! \n\nOur experience was great! Not only were all of the staff friendly and kind, but the vet tech was extra kind and gentle to our cat, Kimba, who is high strung and had urinated all over himself during the car ride to the vet. She took her time to make Kimba feel safe and comfortable before she began examining him. My husband and I (and Kimba) really appreciated that.\n\nWhen Dr. Black came in, she addressed all of our concerns and took a sample from Kimba's ear (we suspected ear mites) and went to look at it under a microscope to see if there were mites. There were. My favorite part was when Dr. Black came in and said she had found mites and asked if I wanted to see them. I totally did! I got to look at them under the microscope and it was sooooo cool! She then gave us a lot of information about how to treat the ear mites and how to make sure our other cats stay mite free. She was also very open and up front about all charges and was very respectful and mindful of our budget. It was so refreshing to go to the vet and not feel like they were pressuring me to run extra tests and to see genuine care and concern for my pet. She addressed the issues that brought us into the office, as well as issues we had mentioned in passing. She gave us a lot of great advice. She even typed up a note containing all of the information we had discussed so we wouldn't forget.\n\nThis was the most painless vet visit ever, for me and for Kimba. I am so glad to have chosen this vet due to reviewers like you. Now I can take my 7 cats and 2 dogs to the vet without dread!", "type": "review", "business_id": "SwJwuo45tippviUGFffzoA"}

We ordered a couple of whole chickens (VERY MOIST!) , yellow rice, beans, fried yucca, sweet plantains, and tostodas.  We loved  the garlic and chili sauces!\nI had visited a PIO PIO serval years ago in Queens, NY and thought it was ok.

Birthday party. Reservations days out.\n\nWe get there and its two separate tables... This is a birthday party, not a adult table and a child table. Takes my peeps a while to get there. Once everyone gets there, we place our order all at the same time. The food comes out three plates at at time, over an hour and a half period. Food is not Mexican, not even a little. Food was basic AF. No spice, no flavor, and kinda cold. The food was all WAY expensive; all at LEAST $18 a plate. The furniture was blocky and quite uncomfortable, and the menus looked like they have NEVER been wiped down in their short lives. Never got a sorry from our waiter, but did get several from the acting manager; whoever that is... \n\nAfter all the ridiculousness we got 50% off the bill and some of us didn't even get our food.

Humble Pie closes at 10, so I can understand a bit of briskness in service.  No biggie.  We were seated, decided on the caprese appetizer and the pistachio pizza.  When our appetizer came, it was a wide soup bowl with about an inch of olive oil in the bottom, a glob of mozzarella, about a half cup of basil pesto, 4 cherry tomatoes and a few slices of bread.  The mozzarella was so tough, we had to use a knife to cut it.  Trying to skewer little, round tomatoes one they've been rolling around in a bath of oil proved to be one of the least glamorous things I've done in a long time.  After wrestling with the appetizer for about 3 minutes, our pizza was brought to us, and it was COVERED in rosemary.  Now, I like spices as much as the next girl, but there was enough on the pizza to actually change the texture.  After eating half of each dish between the two of us, we decided to leave, sans take-out boxes.  My vote is leave the pizza to places like Cibo, P. Bianco and others who have proved themselves.  And as a side-note, please update the music selection for the folks who do dine there.

I'll admit that I wasn't too thrilled to be traveling this far to eat at what appeared to be a little \"hole in the wall,\" located in a strip mall on the corner of Tropicana and Pecos, but we're always down to support small Mom & Pop businesses, so what the hell?\nOur initial observation was that it's small, but nicely decorated.  No booths, just a few tables.  There were several other diners, but we were able to find a table immediately.  The owners were very friendly, and even had their daughter Kailyn assisting them with cleaning tables, etc.  \nI read a previous review in which someone's coffee was too strong, but that was not the case today.  I like mine a bit stronger than most, but was able to add a single creamer with just a bit of sugar to make it perfect for me.  My husband grew up in the mid-West, and loves biscuits & gravy.  I'm not a fan, but at his insistence will usually sample just a bite of his wherever we eat.  Let me just say that this was the most amazing thing we ate this morning, and the owner has perfected it in such a way that I nearly ate half the plate.  \nMy husband and daughter both had the pancake platter, and I ordered the traditional Benny (eggs Benedict).  Everything was delicious!  Some of the best hollandaise I have ever tasted, with thinly sliced Canadian bacon, and my eggs were poached to perfection!  The bacon is thick slab, and their hash browns are cooked fresh, unlike Denny's and IHOP.\nThere were several items on the lunch/dinner menu that we would like to try, so we will probably return for lunch or dinner in the near future.  We're hoping to save some room for the fried cookie dough dessert at some point.  I'm also looking forward to trying the strawberry cream cheese French toast, and candied bacon next time we come back for breakfast!\nThe ONLY reason I didn't give them a full 5 stars was because from my observation, they could possibly use the assistance of one additional person to help wait tables, but I presume that will happen once they become busier... which they will.  While we were there, we made sure to tag our location on our Facebook & Instagram accounts, and many of our friends between here and California are already very excited to try this place, so it's just a matter of time.  I'll add that the lack of help did not affect our dining experience negatively at all, and the owners worked efficiently together to serve us in a timely manner. \nI understand some people may have had a less than perfect experience, but honestly, that happens on occasion everywhere.  We've eaten at some of the best restaurants in Las Vegas & our travels beyond, and have had times where the food or service was not to our expectations, but it's never soured our desire to eat there again.  \nI would recommend that if you are curious to at least give them a try, once for breakfast and once for lunch or dinner.  It never hurts to support a local family's small business, and you'll be eating a great meal while you're at it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8q957qOv1wED08Rgs0-VGg"}

So far, based on my multiple visits, ordered dishes have been good. Most recently, I tried the Portuguese Sausage with 2 eggs, Hoisin Baby Back Ribs, and Furikake Fried Chicken. Everything, I mean everything was good. The sausage plate came with rice and mac salad. The sausages were sweet and not too salty. The rice and mac salad just sealed the deal. Drizzle that egg yolk and mix with the sausage and rice, and get ready for some hit the spot goodness. \n\nThe baby back ribs were near perfection. Pork meat nearly dropped off the bones and the Hoisin glaze was quite a unique sauce experience. The glaze was sweet but not that overly sugary taste you would find at a traditional bbq joint, but more of a refined sweetness. Not sure how to describe in words. Just order the rack.\n\nFurikake chicken was delicious. The texture was crunchy and no where near soggy. Sweet, but not overly sweet. Paired that rice, and my goodness. You can't stop!\n\nThe location is off-strip, but on the way to Red Rock. In fact, it's nice to get away from strip madness on a Vegas strip. Regardless of the location, this is one of my to-go places on every one of my Vegas excursions.", "type": "review", "business_id": "VkPzsY09S4zO0XqhA1mc6Q"}

The place conjures up everything that 'old Vegas' inspires in the minds of anyone of a certain age who is old enough to appreciate the Rat Pack era, but young enough to still be able to stay up as late as Sinatra did back in the day. Red leather banquettes, gold chandeliers, dim lighting, servers dressed at least as well as the patrons...it's all there. We were seated at Betty Grable's booth and promptly greeted by a somewhat aloof server. Our wine and calamari appetizer arrived quickly and we summoned our steaks and sides soon thereafter. We had ordered the signature tableside Caesar salad, but it was unfortunately forgotten. Once our steaks arrived we reminded our server of the forgotten salad and he halfheartedly acknowledged his gaffe. The hostess then arrived and told us that the salad would be compliments of the house. All appreciated. The steaks and salad were very good and prepared precisely as ordered, but once the bill arrived the salad was included. We reminded the hostess of the error and she quickly took care of it. (I wish she was waiting our table that night) Our server returned for the check, but without much to say other than the minimal niceties. All in all we definitely enjoyed our meal, but I have a feeling another server would have taken it to another level.

They have a sleek, modern ambiance and the chairs are really comfy, though they don't look like they would be at all. They had a special 3 course menu at $42.00 a person for the occasion that did not include tax or gratuity.  We each got to choose an appetizer, entre, and desert.  I ordered the butternut squash and parsnip puree soup (exactly what I expected), pheasant with fig and pear glaze and cabbage and apple slaw (amazing) and truffle torte (SUPER rich, but tasty).  My husband had the crab cakes (enough good things can't be said about these.  Holy cow -- the greatest I've had in the Midwest), milk stout braised beef short ribs (my husband liked these but I don't eat red meat so I didn't sample), and the evoo cake (really good and light).  Our server was great and very patient with people coming to our table mid-meal for a drink and then taking off to head downtown for a bit.  We received complimentary champagne during our meal and had a few mixed drinks that were pretty good!  We had a really great dining experience here.  My only complaint:  the gratuity that was not included turned out to be a mandatory 21%.  I've never seen included gratuity that high.  Our waitress was great and she earned it, but I think charging over 20% is a bit tacky.", "type": "review", "business_id": "J9e170ePOgmkaJR1pEFB3Q"}

Granted it wasn't super busy but the lot seemed full and there were plenty of space between each car!!! Unlike some other parking garages in town... Cough, cough... metropolitan were it seems like more of a death trap to go to Trader Joes and Best Buy but I digress.\n\nThere are two levels of parking and four ginormous elevators.  I guess so you and your buggy can make it down to the car with probably 10 other people and their buggies.  What I was happy to see was plenty of bike racks so it just makes me want to ride my bike to get groceries instead of driving.\n\nThe store itself, granted new, was super clean and I got a little lost... But I will learn it all in good time.  Produce was on point, from what I saw from the bakery it looked fairly good as well. They do subs and some prepared foods so I will have to check it out to see how they stack up, but it looks solid.\n\nStaff was super nice and were pretty helpful.

Kind of a cool way to experience different bars in the area. \n\nWe went from 4-6pm and the weather was PERFECT, but I could imagine later in the summer it would be really HOT! I probably wouldn't want to do this during the day in the summer, but evening, sure. \n\nI LOVED the looks from people as you pedaled by. Most would have a look like \"what the....?\" and others would honk and wave. Our driver (I forgot his name, tall, thin, 23.... ugh!) was great and we were jammin some great tunes. Only thing that would make this better would be to have a stripper pole in the middle of the bike. (He said that has been suggested numerous times haha!) If you don't have fun on this thing you are probably lame anyways!", "type": "review", "business_id": "gi0bK6z2CC-hXgO5MKrnPg"}

They have a great convention rate and although it's by the airport the light rail is just a short walk away. The light rail takes about ten minutes to get to the convention center.  Yes, there are nice hotels right next to the convention center. Yes, you will miss out on the fun stuff going on in downtown Phoenix during the con. But if you value a good night's sleep away from the noise, this is a great place to stay.\n\nThe rooms at the Radisson are great, especially the beds! I can't remember the last time I slept so well. The food is expensive but that is fairly typical for this kind of hotel. We ate breakfast at the cafe and had some burgers at the bar. The food is okay, nothing great, but you might find yourself caving in to it anyway since they have a captive audience.  Another advantage to the great service, if you ask at the front desk they can provide you with a number of menus to local places that deliver to the hotel. There is a pizza place that they recommend (can't remember the name offhand) and it is really good.\n\nThe service is excellent. We wanted to take a few beers up to the room on our last night there. Not only did the bartender suggest a good beer that wasn't on the menu but she put together an ice bucket and bottle opener for us! She could not have been nicer. That's just the thing you want after triple digit Phoenix heat! If I come to the convention next year I'm staying here for sure.", "type": "review", "business_id": "i0Y3L91iwCB8acBBqdh9Uw"}

Always puts me right up front for a nice tip and I can have easy access to my car to come and go, love it. \n\n* Great customer service from all the staff even the guys at the bar in the lobby. \n\n* Incredible views from the high floor rooms. I always book an Executive Corner Suite which has sweeping 180 degree views. Their Panoramic Suite has 270 degrees of view with glass lined walls. \n\nThe ECS (Executive Corner Suite) has two bathrooms one is a 1/2 bath and the other full, full kitchen, living area, dining table and large bedroom. There's even a washer and dryer (stack) which I like so I don't have to go home with dirty clothes and usually do my laundry in room the night before. \n\nThey have a small market/cafe in the lobby as well and great room service. The hotel is connected to Bellagio through a walk-way, a 5 minute walk to the Cosmopolitan and less than that to Aria which is right across the drive. There's plenty of casino action in those hotels so if I need to play - that's where I go. \n\nThe pool area at Vdara is nice too. Quiet and not as lively as say the Cosmo or some of the beach club resort pools in town. \n\nReally don't want to stay anywhere else when I do Vegas!

They were informed of our intentions and gave us a room dedicated to our  group.  We gathered at 5pm, the crown drifting in over the course of an our or so.\n\nThere were lots of chips and salsa in squeeze bottles.  The salsa was actually the best part of the night.  It was hot enough without being overbearing and the chips were fresh and in a big enough basket we were not dependent on our disappearing waitress to have them replenished.  \n\nIt took quite a while to get the waitress to take our drink orders and even longer for the dinner order to be placed and eventually served.  There were only two waitresses, one of which was elsewhere most of the time as the other was running her tail off.  \n\nSadly, we were sitting with our backs directly against the entry to the kitchen and there was lot of noise.  This added to the clumsiness of the staff who dropped multiple plates on the floor and shattered glass and food all over the backs of our legs as they came out of the kitchen.  As if it took long enough to get one meal out, now add this to they delay.  \n\nOnce our food finally arrived, about 1 hour and 45 minutes into the time there,  it was a sad disappointment at best.  Phil ordered a Chimichanga which looked like it was deep fried in dirty oil for 3 times the normal cooking time.  It was so dark brown it looked like it was covered in Mole'.  Rosealyn's Cheese crisp was anything but crisp, more like it was soaking in an oil bath before arriving at the table.  My Green Chicken Enchilada's were seemingly tasty at first but I paid for them in the bathroom the following day for hours on end as they ran through me like a scoop of Draino.  I love Mexican food and can handle the hottest but his recipe's did me in.  \n\nGetting the check was another delay.  It was 8pm when we finally got out of there, not a moment too soon.\n\nThe bottom line here is it was good to see and meet some new and old friends but I would have rather done it somewhere else.  The restaurant was ill-prepared for our arrival, the food was sub standard and the after effects were more like a visit from Montezuma, something I would prefer to do without.

Amazing work they've done here. I love going to museums, and especially if it's a museum with things that fascinate me. I've been a big fan of the Boardwalk Empire show on HBO, so coming here made it an extra bonus for me!\n\nFirstly, you need MORE than a day to go through all the historical artifacts, play the interactive games, and read all the information. You'll read all the info on Frank Costello, Al Capone, Lucy Luciano, Oscar Goodman, and more than 150 mobsters around the world! You'll learn how they died what the significance of how they died represents, how you get initiated into the family, and what kind of crimes they get themselves into.\n\nMy personal favorite artifact is the courtroom. It is all the original pieces from the same courtroom that Estes Kefauver of Tennessee had done all of the great hearings against some great mobsters like Frank Costello. Could you imagine sitting in the benches, and thinking about how Frank Costello sat RIGHT IN FRONT a long time ago? It's pretty amazing.\n\nAnyway, what's great about this museum is that it's not just artifacts and reading a bunch of stuff. You're interacting with a lot of their fun interactive features, playing games, listing to actual phone taps, hiding in crate boxes. It really gives you an idea how and what it's like to be a mobster or be an officer who fights crime. It's good for everyone, especially people who are more into looking at pictures and playing with things than reading. Can't wait to go back and finish looking at all of the stuff I missed!\n\nAlso, note. $10 for locals and I think $18 for regular priced. :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "eUbpbGBSe0oQneuAenPasw"}

The chicken is a solid item with great tastes gong on.  The pork taco, on the other hand, knocked my socks off.  The meat itself was seasoned and cooked to perfection and worked well with both the flour and the soft corn shells.  What got me going was the pineapple mango salsa that topped this beauty, it was a beautiful complement to the meat and offered a new take on the taco.  \nAs far as sides go, I keep going back to the mexican street corn:  think grilled corn on the cobb with some saucy goodness.  Warning: not beard friendly but definitely tongue lovin.  \nAppetizers - The chips and salsa  trio's blend includes some great tastes (my fave is the pineapple-mango..go figure) and the Guac trio also serves up nicely.  The wings pack tasty heat that doesn't dissapoint.\n\nThe atmosphere:  Stylish, fun.  Booths and tables were comfortable.  The long table at the bar with bar-height metal stools - not so much.

The room was clean and comfortable.  Both the living room tv and master room tv come complete with dvd player, and as we knew it was going to be a hot weekend (114 degrees) we brought movies to watch during the afternoons.\n\nThe pool, while one large pool, is broken down with two parts, 1 side straight for the lap swimmers, and the other curved for the kids to play around and do their thing.  The depth goes to 5ft and diving isn't allowed. There's a seperate wading pool and 2 hot tubs, one in the main pool area and a 2nd around the gate for adults only.\n\nThere are tennis courts, volleyball area, and playground for the kids.  The kids playground was covered so there was no direct sunlight beating down on us.\n\nThere's a Walmart Essentials close by and we stocked up on food there to supply us through the weekend.\n\nThis is a timeshare so when you check in, there is some pressure to take a meeting during your stay, but after saying no a few times, we went on with a relaxing weekend.  \n\nWe look forward to another stay in April, during the kids spring break when we can arrange time with the grandparents to fly from Chicago and stay with us.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bEGEVhL86L-2d-wSqAWhfw"}

Je crois que malgr\u00e9 la petite superficie, ils auraient pu mieux l'am\u00e9nager, mais pour le prix et la proximit\u00e9, je ne vais pas chialer. \n\nNourriture : J'adore leur menu. Ils ont une grande s\u00e9lection de poissons/viandes qu'on peut choisir avec un m\u00e9lange d'ingr\u00e9dients inspirants, ce qui rend le tout simple et int\u00e9ressant. On mange le tartare avec des chips, cro\u00fbtons, feuilles d'algues ou c\u00e9leri. Ils ont aussi des patates douces en accompagnements et plusieurs plats de salades d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e9par\u00e9s qui sont bons.  J'ai aussi essay\u00e9 leur plateau de d\u00e9gustation et le plateau de poissons qui permettent de gouter \u00e0 tous les viandes et tous les assisonnements. J'ai aim\u00e9 la plupart des assaisonnements, car ils ne viennent pas camoufler le go\u00fbt du poisson. Mon pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9, c'est l'assaisonnement \"Russe\" (Vodka, lime, tobiko, betterave, oignon). Les bols de salade-tartare umami sont originaux comme plat, mais j'avais encore faim apr\u00e8s. \n\nPrix: Sur le site, le menu semble avoir chang\u00e9, mais la derni\u00e8re fois que je suis all\u00e9 (automne 2014), c'\u00e9tait une s\u00e9lection plus restreinte que leur restaurant avec salle \u00e0 manger, mais moins ch\u00e8re. Pour les plateaux de d\u00e9gustation ou de poissons, c'est des bons plateaux pour partager \u00e0 deux avec des accompagnements ou avec l'ajout de quelques tartares. On s'en tire habituellement autour de 30$ par personne. Si vous avez de plus petits app\u00e9tits, ils offrent de plus petites portions. En effet, on choisit entre 100, 150 ou 200g de viande/poisson.", "type": "review", "business_id": "yrDBLxE2WBcDo2V4jqgt2Q"}

This seriously is the WORST, I mean very WORST fast food place ever.  They hire really lame employees and do not properly stock their supplies.\n\nWe've been here a few times and we know how McDonald's food tastes, not real great, but this one is way subpar.  I remember one time and this was over a year ago, we ordered a bunch of stuff for a family of four.  They told us they didn't have everything cook and had us pull around and wait.  We were in the drive-thru.  So, we did.\n\nNearly 1/2 hr goes by.  We see people enter the place and leave the place with food, but still ours wasn't done.  I finally went in and asked about it.  They said, oh, sorry.  We got the food and when I went back to the car to check, the food was fricken' cold.\n\nAre you serious?  I went back in and asked for a refund, which they didn't want to give me a refund, but finally they did.  We left the place really hungry, no food, and very aggravated.\n\nSeveral times, this was the closest McDonald's and we needed ice.  I tell you, 100% of the time, they were always out of bags of ice.  Really?  I've actually never been to a McDonald's where they ran out of ice.  If you don't sell, ice, then why advertise for it?\n\nWe honestly thought maybe they were having an off day, but there have been maybe a couple other times where we got the food and it tasted like it had been sitting for hours under some heat lamp.  Ugggh.  \n\nSo, though this McDonald's is the closest to where we live, if we need ice or some fast food, we make sure never to go to this one again.  The people are beyond unintelligent and totally lack customer service.\n\nWhomever is the owner for this franchise needs to do a better job of selecting their people and seeing that they provide good customer service and follow good protocols as the rest of the McDonald's.  \n\nAt this point, it's a joke between my husband and I about this McDonald's and I don't even know how they stay in business.  They definitely are not following McDonald's standards for how to run a business.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8tGQZpKXJzQEu0we77w7eg"}

However, when you get inside, this place is packed and bustling.  \n\nWe ended up sitting at the bar, which was great!  Everyone was very nice to us and we had great service during our entire meal. \n\nMy husband ordered the Country Fried Steak which is ginormous.  You can probably feed about 2-3 people with that dish.  It was heavy but yummy!  \n\nI ordered the oatmeal to be healthy and it was huge!  Portion sizes seem to be pretty large here.  It was really good as it was topped with some cinnamon roasted apples.  I didn't have to sweeten the oatmeal at all because it was so good. \n\nMy friend ordered pancakes which were amazing!  The pancakes were light and fluffy and just delicious!  It's on my list to order next time.  \n\nWe also ordered the beignets which I was slightly disappointed about.  I think I've had the ones at Disneyland way too much and nothing can come close to those.  These were decent but just not how I like them which are soft and just melt in your mouth yummy with all the powdered sugar on top. \n\nThere are a ton of other things I want to try on their menu but since I don't live in Las Vegas it looks like I would only be able to eat here whenever we go to the outlets.  It's now on my must stop list for Vegas. \n\nI also loved their wheat toast!!  You must be thinking that toast is toast but here the toast is fresh, light, fluffy and thick and it's toasted on their griddle.  One word to describe it ... Yummy.  If you like toast, you have to try that here.   \n\nYou have to come with an empty stomach because you will leave completely full.

When you run down to the lounge to grab breakfast prior to your 9am meeting and the pans are stuck with leftovers from the night before, you might be frustrated, but you tell yourself this kind of thing happens from time to time.\n\nOver a two month period, I stayed at this Westin five times.

That doesn't mean much, though, when you end up with scabies all over your legs, chest, and arms.\n\nThe crusted scabs between my fingers were probably most disgusting. It took over three weeks for the red bites and itching to go away after taking the prescription medication my doctor provided.\n\nWhen the front desk billed the wrong credit card to settle charges at the end of the week, I contacted the billing department. I left a few messages with the billing/accounts manager. He promptly returned my first call, but hasn't returned a single call since.\n\nYes, this hotel is beautiful. But the service is downright horrendous. I, for one, am not willing to get another round of scabies. I like to eat in the morning. I want my room key to open my door after a long day.

He said he couldn't do that for me, so I told him that I wasn't satisfied with that so he said \"fine, I'll take $50 off your room rate\". He actually said \"fine\" to me in a childish way. What kind of a hotel manager talks to a customer like that? The next morning I went downstairs to check out and the manager didn't leave a note about the $50 off. The front desk lady was inexperience as well and had to get the assistant manager to come out and speak to me. She then had to call the manager to ask what had happened and he told her that he was going to give me $50 off resort credit!! Why would I want that? I went back and forth with the assistant manager for about 30 min just to get credited back. Never should a customer have to go through this much bs. Especially when the hotel is at fault. In any business, it should be 'I'm sorry for the inconvenience here is what I can do for you'. Instead I had to explain what happened and be thrown around from one person to other. I wish I had my convo recorded so everyone could hear what an ass this manager was. I can not believe this hotel could hire such an inexperienced person to represent such a hotel. Never will I come back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "WIlklz81DcJkUWJThbnJbQ"}

I started to see results after just 2 weeks! \nThe very term \"boot camp\" is enough to produce images of a Jillian Michaels type trainer screaming orders and insults in rapid succession while I'm crying, sweating and begging for mercy; however, FBBC is nothing like that. The Trainers, although tough, are fair and friendly. \nThe 30 minute workout consists of a warm up jog then 5 stations that change every day. Each station is 1 minute (you can do ANYTHING for 60 seconds!)with a 30 second break after each 5 minute rotation. 3 rotations then 5 minutes of abs complete the workout. By the time the class is over you have worked every major muscle group as well as abs to the point you are shaking. You leave class feeling triumphant, accomplished and proud that you finished! \nAccommodations can be made for physical limitations without making you feel like a whiner. \nThis workout is great for all fitness levels- beginner to advanced as each station can be modified. The trainers push you outside of your comfort zone but not so hard that you are injured, as with other programs I've tried. \nMargherita and Mike get to know you on a personal level which makes it easier to return day after day. \nI would unequivocally recommend Fit Body Boot Camp to anyone looking for an alternate to the big fitness center where nobody knows your name or cares about your goals!", "type": "review", "business_id": "iFif-xZyjwq-DNC-vUsQrw"}

It simply didn't provide the quality you would expect from a business that sells only one product.  In fact, I don't feel they delivered quality at all.\n\nI paid $22 for 6 cupcakes.  If I wasn't out of town for a week, I would have brought them back and asked for a refund.  I think it says a lot when you have a dinner party and still have 5 of 6 cupcakes left over at the end of the night.\n\nThe cake portion wasn't as good as a box cake mix.  I can't remember the time I've had a (cup)cake that was that lackluster.  It wasn't notably moist, didn't have a distinct texture, and most importantly had zero flavor.  I ordered 3 different varieties and all tasted exactly the same.\n\nThe frosting was equally disappointing.  Again, none had much flavor other than \"sweet.\"  Truly, funfetti icing tastes far better.\n\nAlthough taste is most important, I also feel the presentation was lacking quite a bit for cupcakes that cost nearly $4 a piece.  There was no design, the frosting was kind of just thrown on top, nothing fancy in terms of bags or boxes... and what I thought was kind of funny... each cupcake had this hand-made, tacky sign stuck into it (think piece of scrap paper, hand-written flavor, taped to a tooth pick - tacky grandma's house style).\n\nLook, I'll eat just about anything.

The service was adequate but not quite what you would expect when dining at such a fine spot.  It wasn't as if the service was bad, it was fine.  I would just expect exceptional for such a quality restaurant.  Our servers were nice and attentive overall.  The minor slips were that the crumbs on the table should have been bussed between courses and our server was not certain what the main liquor was in one of their signature cocktails.  Smiling and being friendly makes up for some of this, however.\n\nThe food was easily a 5 star rating.  We shared 9 charcuterie items among the 6 of us.  We had the Italian mix as put together by the chef and added the spiced almonds, white anchovies and duck.  This may be the best appetizer option in the city.  Portions sizes are enough for everyone to try.  The multiple tastes and flavors make your tongue dance.  The lardo was wonderful.  Here is a tip...  don't even bother with the butter.  Wait for your lardo to arrive and slather away...\n\nThe appetizers were tremendous.  My wife and I shared three apps and split an entree.  The apps were the ravioli (save bread to soak up the wonderful sauce), tuna tartare (pretty standard app these days but theirs was set apart by the addition of citrus which made it pop!), and brussel sprouts.  I also tasted a neighbor's scallop app.  All were terrific.  Appropriately portioned, extremely well prepared and unique tastes.\n\nWe shared the Walleye.  They kindly split the entree into two plates and the half portions were close to what a full entree might be.  The walleye was excellent.  Perfectly crispy outside and tender inside.\n\nBeer and cocktails were good.  They have a nice tap selection that had 3-4 seasonals.  The cocktails were more than just the usual suspects and were well prepared.\n\nI really loved the ambiance.  Warm brown hues with just enough light to make it feel intimate but not stuffy.

What saved the day was the free breakfast, the the chef was slinging omelets like a mad man.  I hope they pay him well.  A decent selection for a free breakfast.   A little bit of a scary neighborhood (questionable to be out at night), but the over all value was okay... accept, I have to complain about the $9.95 per day wi-fi fee.

This place is no longer Afghan food.  It is now an Indian restaurant with both North and South Indian dishes.  \n\nMy husband and I were very disappointed as we loved the Afghan food there.  Apparently the change came about 12 days ago, so it's very new.  We thought it might just be another Indian food experience, but it was amazingly good Indian food.  We've tried many Indian restaurants (including Guru Palace and The Dhaba) in the Tempe and Mesa areas and this was the best we've had.  \n\nWe started our meal with veggie samosas which were good.  We then had a long wait for our main dishes, but the waitress kept our drinks filled and apologized for the wait (this is one thing that could be improved).  But then, when we got our dishes, we were blown away.  We ordered the ginger lamb curry and the Malai Kofta both a la carte style which comes with rice and plain naan included (a helpful change from most restaurants where you order that extra).  The ginger lamb curry was tasty with lots of ginger and very tender lamb.  The Malai Kofta was very good with a wonderful sauce.  Their naan was excellent - very fluffy - some of the best we've had in town.  The rice was seasoned a little bit too, which is nice.  We used that naan to clean out our bowls and might have licked the plate if we hadn't been in public.  \n\nWe can't wait to go back and try more of the dishes.  We could see dosas being served at other tables and they looked very large and good.   They also have a lunch buffet and we want to go try that too.\n\nAll in all, I'm sad to not have an Afghan restaurant around anymore, but their Indian dishes were wonderful!  \n\nThe prices were just over $10 for a la carte entrees, but that does include the rice and naan.  With appetizer and one drink, our dinner for two was just about $30.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ZeJArxfvuV1rAAGT5Xe5Yw"}

We were seated immediately but it was about 9 on a Wednesday so I can't tell you for sure if they ever get super busy but I have a feeling they do. The location is about 4 miles from where we stayed off the strip so it's not a terrible drive.\n\nThe hostess who sat us didn't really help us much because we hadn't been there and we were confused as to why we didn't get menus but they are in the paper (actual newspaper looking) she sat us with. So that was cute.\n\nWe ordered the classic eggs benedict and the country fried steak. Both super delicious. Hand down the best chicken fried steak because the batter is so light and you can cut the steak with the butter knife. Anthony chose to have a biscuit with his meal which was light and fluffy and delicious with both butter and jelly. My eggs benedict we delicious and I had never had it with slices of ham instead of a ham steak and that was yummy because I got more ham with my bite. They also come with a bowl of fruit and hash browns which were crispy on top and fluffy in the middle.\n\nBoth dishes were delicious and we can definitely see ourselves coming back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "fkVBloMEFJG2HTgeCxeNDg"}

The first time was ok, everything was swimming in oil but the flavors were pretty good and I liked the variety on the buffet.  This time was terrible.  The only Indian meal I have had that was worse was the one I had in this same space with the previous owners.  From top to bottom the dishes lacked depth of flavor and were lacking in some way or another.  The naan was buried in garlic powder and was inedible.  The gulab is served cold and was mushy.  The saag had poor consistancy and flavor.  The channa was cooked improperly and didn't taste good.  Everything was buried in cayenne to the extreme and it was inedible.  The pakora was good and I ate some tandoor because I was hungry.  I like some heat.  \n\nI like the heat you build with fresh and dried chiles.  I do not appreciate the sharp and flavorless heat you get when you dump a bunch of cayenne in a dish.

What a great location with so much room to play! There could be a bit better signage from the road though. I had tried coming here on a previous visit, got confused on the exact location and then they were closed for some reason and I couldn't get in touch with anyone over the phone. This facility looked really cool and they have a huge space and parking lot available that I was hoping we might be using to do tire flips, sled pulls or some other fun stuff to enjoy the nice sunny outdoors.\n\nAnyway, this time my friends and I arrived early to fill out the required waiver, etc. but ended up waiting until after the scheduled class time for the coach to arrive. Not really cool... especially since there were another 10 or so visitors waiting also, along with many members. Being a coach myself, I thought this was unacceptable. The coach was nice enough though and made it a point to have the visitors introduce themselves, which I thought was considerate. The warm-up took longer than the actual WOD and since we were already running late, the workout felt rushed. The coach seemed somewhat preachy in her approach and chastised some regular members for joking/chatting, which I didn't agree with since we are adults, not grade-schoolers and we want to have fun, not just workout. BUT, she seemed knowledgable, smiled a lot and was as friendly as she could be considering the big class size.\n\nThe WOD was not great though. Instead of something a little fun and longer, which a lot of gyms do on Saturdays, we did a 15 min partner AMRAP with rep ranges too long for either partner to really get in a good \"sprint\" so-to-speak during their time working. I ended up with a rather lame 7 minutes of total work... for $30 (including the t-shirt). Several visitors and members were conferring as to how it could have been split up differently for a better WOD. \n\nI did think the option of returning on subsequent days for a \"free\" workout was a nice gesture instead of having to pay again. But instead of going back to CFME, my friends and I just jogged to the local park, ran stairs, lunged, squatted and did pushups to get a more well-rounded workout for free.\n\nIn closing, my intent here is not to be a downer but I did want to provide honest feedback from an experienced perspective. I would want the same thing if someone came to my gym.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DDmAZ6lep3RUTf9CEsO1uA"}

Prices seemed reasonable, not cheap but ok. I saw they have shakes, I'm a fan of good shakes(Jack in the Box's real ice creams shakes are killa!) but I had to pass on that, maybe on the next visit. I asked what the difference between the two sizes is. 1/3 and 1/2lb patty. I decided on the Sin City burger Big Size & order of Smash fries(tossed in olive oil, rosemary & garlic). Sin City comes with bacon, their sauce and an egg. Eggs can be an awesome burger/sandwich topping so that clinched it as the first burger to try! Burger was a nice size and delicious. The fries, I really wasn't sure. Being my first time I tried a few fries first to taste them but I really couldn't tell if there was any rosemary and/or garlic. Far as I could tell it either wasn't really well seasoned/tossed or they gave me regular fries cause they sure seemed like regular fries...Service was good so I was sitting around 3.5 stars for this place since the only real disappointment was the fries. \nStill, would be enough to warrant another try in the future.", "type": "review", "business_id": "yo3zehm-cIQLO1mtDsMGXA"}

I didn't really dig the sweet potato fries- everyone we were with recommended them very highly, but I found them too sugary. I think a chile lime or saltier topping would've been more aligned with my palate. If I go again, I'll try their other fries to be fair.

It felt like greek roman times with the archangels Michael and Gabriel in front of the hotel looking towards Las Vegas Blvd. \n\nThe Rooms\nI would only recommend friends I know to either stay at the Palazzo or the Venetian because of their luxurious suites to be accomodated in and for such a good rate if you book ahead of time. The bed is so comfy and easy to fall asleep on. The couch in the living room is a pull out bed if you try and cram more than XX amount of people in a room. 3 Flat Screen TVs one in front of the bed; one in front of the tv, one in the living room, and one in the bathroom while you taking a soothing bath. For you ladies that wanna get dolled up and what not they have a little section with a vanity mirror so you can take hours on yourself. \n\nThe Swimming Pool\nThis is the hottest item during the summer time and jaccuzi is very soothing and relaxing. Many people take advantage of the massage treatment its a good 50minutes of your life :) \n\nThe Food\nThey also provide a very convienent food court on the 2nd and 1st floor if you're lazy to go out and get other food. Grand Lux Cafe is actually a good place to eat at. \n\nCasino\n-I'm not a big gambler but they got it all, hey you never know you could get lucky :) \n\nNightlife\nTAO: Venetian biggest and successful nightclub which is always crackin on the weekends. Since you're a guest ask for a complimentary fast to get in free but fellas might have a hard time getting in unless you go really early like 9pm early if not make sure you have a good guy/girl ratio \n\nValet \nTip for thought: DON'T LOST YOUR VALET TICKET\nThis past weekend my friend lost his valet ticket and his name wasn't the one registered to the vehicle so they had to call security and inspect the items inside the vehicle and make sure it is your vehicle before they release it to you, so embarassing! \n\nNonetheless I highly recommend staying at a Venetian Suite if you have family or friends for a great getaway vacay.

The lobby was very nice, service was excellent, poolside drink and food service was available. There is even room service available which is rare.\n\nThe room was clean and very spacious. I would recommend asking for a 3rd floor room. Most of the rooms lining the golf course have trees in front of them blocking any view, but the 3rd floor provides spectacular scenery. There is a full kitchen and refrigerator in the Deluxe room which is great if you are bringing children. I think the standard room has a kitchenette, but not sure.\n\nYou can jump on a really convenient 2 minute shuttle to the hotel side of the resort. A larger pool and a lazy river await as well as the \"flowrider\" surf simulator. Note: the flowrider is not complimentary and has to be booked. Appointments are easy to make though and from 4:00 pm on it is considered happy hour and much cheaper. You can also take the shuttle to the Scottsdale Commons about 1 minute away where there are world-class restraunts and shopping. We literally didn't leave that area the whole time, so I wouldn't be too concerned with not being near old-town Scottsdale. Trust me, you will not feel any void with the amount of choices you have in the immediate area.\n\nIf you are an SPG member, check out the AAA rate and avoid trying to book with starpoints. At 20,000 per night I would say it's not the best exchange rate and the cash rates are very reasonable.\n\nOverall a great experience.", "type": "review", "business_id": "LfvQnSv2MbIplgAfpXkUQw"}

I dream of their crepes all the time. My favorite is their chocolate crepe, which has brownie bits, chocolate sauce, and whipped cream. I don't share. Can't do it. I've had the souffle version and I thought it was simply too heavy, and this is coming from a person who loves anything decadent when it comes to dessert. It'd probably be better off with a fruit topping if you order the souffle. I've also had the apple and pecan and loved it. The pecans complement everything very well.  I've also tasted the passion with coconut gelato and that was also really good. I would not order the bananas foster here. The bananas are overcooked and mushy. If you're a banana fan, hop on over to Mon Ami Gabi and order it there. \n\nPastries and desserts\nI've tried the opera cake here and thought it was just too much sugar and didn't have enough flavor. The sugar overpowered everything. I've had their pastries and love love love their almond croissant. Their dulce de leche brioche is okay... I like their croissants better. I've also had their hazelnut eclair and thought that was pretty good, although I wouldn't order it again. Also had their Mother's Day special one year and thought it was delicious!\n\nSavory\nSad to say I have not really had any of their savory menu items, but definitely plan on trying their smoked salmon. I had their veggie sandwich, not the caprese, but the roasted vegetable and thought the bread was a little too airy and felt like I didn't eat much. My mother had their tomato chicken and wants it every time we go there now. Apparently the tomatoes make the sandwich outstanding.\n\nCoffee\nI always buy a couple bags of their whole bean perfect roast. It is so perfect I drink it black. It keeps me sane while waiting for my next trip to Vegas to visit JPP. Their caramel twist is their perfect roast sweetened with caramel syrup and topped with whipped cream. Tastes like a caramel macchiato and pretty good. I've also had their white chocolate and plain mocha which are good, nothing absolutely special. \n\nCandy and such\nI love their chocolate nougat. Their vanilla nougat is more firm and chewier and I like them both. They are loaded with nuts and not cheap on the pistachios. Their chocolate cookies with the white chocolate on top is absolutely amazing. They use Valrhona and it shows. Their white chocolate on the cookie complements it well. Peanut butter is okay, but I think Bouchon's Better Nutter is, well, better. Their was this one candy I couldn't stop eating. It looks like polished rocks, I forgot what it's called. It's basically sugar covered apricots and such and that is definitely a treat and hits the sweet spot. I have a high tolerance for sweets and this was pure sugar, but in a delightful way. I have to remind myself I ate the largest tube in one sitting and not to buy that size ever again.  Their biscottis are pretty good and not hard or gritty or too sweet.\n\nJean Philippe is a MUST. A vegas trip for me is not complete without at least one crepe here and going home without their perfect roast coffee beans would be a nightmare... It's the only thing I have to look forward to when I come back home to reality and have to sit in a cubicle all day.", "type": "review", "business_id": "szw8OGJlsqaA3i2oe7dn9A"}

It has been the worst experience we have ever had, and my husband has stayed at numerous  Marriott accommodations. On Tuesday around 2:15 a.m or so, I was chatting to my sis on my cell phone on the bed closest to the door, because my hubby was asleep on the other bed and I didn't want to disturb his sleep.  I looked down at the comforter and could not believe what I saw... I was looking at a urine stain on the comforter. I was disgusted and appalled!!! Can we say disgusted again!!! But it doesn't stop their... Theirs also lipstick on the comforter in two places... This is the same bed my husband and I cuddled in the night before. My stomach starts turning!!! The reason I didn't notice the stains is because the comforter is covered by a thin cover. I call the front desk and speak to Ms Hernandez who tells me she can put us in another room, and also told me that she would give us points. Long story short we are in a new room after 4 am. My husband lost sleep, and I am appalled!!!  So we're in Room 604 now, we were in Room 704.

So I definitely cannot use the hooks!  To add to the list.. trash under the bed and stains under the sink.  House keeping was sent to clean everything. This is appalling, seriously!!! I cried, my hubby and I rarely get away, (we have 8 children n yes they are all ours) I hope no one else has to go through this!!! It truly put a damper on our trip.

Cheeses I managed to note, largely because they are the ones we ordered, included Saelers, Tome des Bauges, Emmental de Savoie, Beaufort, Mimolette, Brie de Meaux, Cabecou, Cantal, Valencay, Camembert de Normandie, Epoisses de Bourgogne, Laguiole, Comte, Morbier, and Bleu de Bresse.  Large portions, easily an ounce each, we received a total of 16 flavors divided into four plates - one ash, one mild and creamy, one pungent, and one aged.  Served with a baguette and walnut raisin roll I personally loved the Mimolette, Brie, Valencay, and Morbier.\n\nLa Sph\u00e8re de Sucre - Fuji apple confit, almond praline cake, Tahitian vanilla sabayon, praline ice cream.  The perfect crystal ball shattering with minimal pressure from the spoon, the sweet cream, the supple bread, the ice cream, the fruit - every bit as good as my passion fruit version last fall but even better given my love of apples.\n\nLa Pomme - Essentially a Baba cake at its base, the choux pastry rested in a creamy and cool Fuji apple mousse and Tahitian vanilla cream, while atop sat a pearl of green apple sorbet and a crispy candied apple fleur.  Buttery and smooth, as beautiful in the mouth as to the eye - the flavor was that of a grown up apple dumpling in heavy cream.\n\nLes Banans - a meringue sort of Ille Flotant on ice.  With honey mousse at its center atop a mountain of banana ice, the meringue was intentionally unsettled and contained a center of caramelized bananas.  Topped with banana chips and lime zest the dish was intensely sweet to be certain, but at the same time self assured and balanced when everything was taken together.\n\nLes Banans 2 - the dish would be presented in a long cylindrical glass and the alternating layers would present a parfait of sorts.  With alternating layers of fresh cut banana, house made vanilla wafers, nougat, honeycomb, banana cream, and milk sorbet this dish was perhaps the least \"fussed with\" of the night (aside from the black plate painted with edible gold pain) but the flavors worked perfectly.  Bite by bite, taste by taste, each spoonful offered a totally different taste and sensation.\n\nL'Orange - a light and refreshing citrus dessert featuring orange segments poached in an infusion of Ceylon Pekoe tea at top and bottom.  Between the orange layers would be a thin layer of salty caramel, a bruleed layer of yogurt mousse, a quenelle of orange sorbet, and crunchy bits that tasted like pralines made from macadamia nuts.  Tthe flavor profile was actually quite unique and unexpected with the notes of tea actually substantially smoothing out the citrus and allowing the caramel to shine.\n\nLa Poire - confit anjour pear, foam of almonds and Anisette, pear sorbet.  Largely liquid with small chunks of intensely sweet pear beneath this would be my second dessert with  licorice tones in two days and again it would serve notice that when used with restraint the flavor can be quite pleasant.  With almond top notes and the licorice flavor only present on the palate the dish was a solid palate cleanser for what was next.\n\nLe Chocolat - Comprised as a sort of parfait, the first dish arrived in a cup with a chocolate shell over the top.  Beneath the shell, chocolate wafers, chocolate mousse, chocolate butter cake, chocolate ganache, and winter fruit confit.  Using 66% Valrhona as the based and some lighter chocolates throughout the dish was exactly what the ingredients would dictate - a little citrus, a lot chocolate, and texturally lovely.\n\nLe Chocolat 2 - white chocolate sabayon with lemon confit at the base and add the topping of rich coffee Ice cream, chocolate ribbons, and caramelized walnuts.  Hesitant at first as I don't prefer citrus toned coffees let alone lemon and coffee together, the white chocolate cream actually masked the citrus quite nicely and if anything the lemon actually helped to enhance the more floral notes of the coffee and chocolate combination.\n\nTrolley of mignardises would arrive next with the a selection that included but was not limited to:  Passion fruit marshmallow, salted caramels, confit ginger covered with chocolate, chocolate dome, dark truffle with mint, chocolate covered orange peel, liquid caramel centered chocolate, pinapple pate a fruit, white chocolate bark with puffed rice and orange, a chouxcette, strawberry cheesecake in white chocolate, tuile of almond and citrus, pear gelee filled with brandy, blackberry opera cake, chocolate religieux, blueberry financier, dry pineapple with white chocolate, raspberry praline, canele, white nougat, and at least 15 other selections.  Choices made I'll note the while the canele was a bit soft, the financier, opera cake, pear gelee, and cheesecake were all sublime.\n\nAmazing.", "type": "review", "business_id": "wfofFm3AqtyK_ujNQ893mQ"}

Some couches, computer cubies and a few tables.   \n\nBecause I had read the reviews I immediately knew I was going to order the LGBTQ sandwich and it didn't disappoint.

But still nice wood tables and chairs. And limited parking- high traffic area, by 168 Market and across from Cafe Moda. \n\nThey were very busy, long line, moves somewhat fast. It's fusion Filipino/mexican type food, with tacos, burritos, and bowls with foods like chicken adobo.. and did i mention the sisig burritos are so yummy!!!..yummy....yum! Cole slaw is good, but a little vinegary. Food is fresh, fresh, and gooooood!!!!\n\n Its somewhat \"fast food \" done food truck style, but still have good service. The person on register is always friendly, and they call your name when foods ready. They forgot our drinks and sides, but were still friendly and brought them over right away. While waiting in line, one of the promoters came around and handed out t-shirts. Very nice touch! \n\nPrice is ok, its like 8 bucks for a 3 taco combo, with choice of 3 meats, 1 side, and a drink. Its a bit o'greasy, so not an everyday lunch meal...but if they park a \"truck\" outside my campus i'd def. change that last statement :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "em3gydy9BgDBzMTmhKpt5A"}

Once your feet dry, you're ready for the massage to start.\n\nThe massage is done on a pad on the floor with the therapist at the same level as you are.  This seems to give them better leverage and access to your muscles. My therapist used her thumbs, hands, elbows, knees, and feet to great effect.

I enjoyed every bite of my meal and the service was fantastic. Hubby and I were seated at a roomy booth and our drinks were never empty. A basket of warm bread with butter came out quick and tasted great. The price for the RW menu was $50.14 per person and I enjoyed the following for that price before tax:\n\nThe Famous Original Spinning Bowl Salad - This is made right at your table. Our server, Ms. Huang had 2 metal bowls that spun as she added the dressing. The salad had lettuce, beets, hard boiled eggs, croutons and their signature vintage dressing. I haven't ever tasted a salad like this before. It was suggested that I add some of the Lawry's seasoning that was on the table, so I did. The salad tasted so fresh and delicious. Very good.\n\nMashed Potatoes - This was a nice addition to my plate. The mashed potatoes are whipped with butter and milk and tasted perfect. The brown gravy that came on it was good. \n\nButtered Peas - Yum! Being on the same plate, the peas ended up with brown gravy and au jus on them which I like. Plus, I just like peas!\n\nYorkshire Pudding - This comes in a skillet by itself. It tasted great and was perfect for soaking up the last bits of gravy on my plate. it was soft and really good. \n\nPrime Rib - 8 ounces of pure heaven! A carver came to the table with a cart of prime rib and let me pick how I wanted it and then carved it right in front of me. I like mine a little more done and that's just what I got. The prime rib was so tender and literally fell apart. It had such great flavor. To say I didn't leave here stuffed would be absolutely wrong! Everything tasted good, but the prime rib was the true star.\n\nCreme Brulee - This had fresh berries on top and It tasted so good, but I could only eat half because I was so full. \n\nCoffee - Tasted great and was a perfect way to end the meal. At this point I just needed a pillow for a nap!\n\nI can't say enough about our server. She was fantastic and took great care of us. The manager on duty, Wendy came over and chit chatted with us for maybe 10 minutes and she was warm and friendly. She let us know a little about the lunch menu which sounds like a winner.

Luckily, I found Dean's on Yelp and the three good reviews had me heading over there to figure out what was wrong with my gas tank and gas gauge. Right away over the phone, I was given the rundown that the estimate is free and they would even shuttle me back to my place while the process unfolded. When I arrived at Dean's, there were several older women waiting for their cars to be fixed and they were telling me that this place has been around for over 50 years and they have been bringing their cars in for decades to get fixed which was comforting. There are photos on the wall of years gone past and that says they have been doing something right. As for my car, Grant found a way to get into my tank through the trunk saving several hours in labor costs and also identified other parts I needed as he figured out my problem. My car was bought used so i didn't know it needed a new battery and fuel filter, which I am glad they discovered. I was kept mostly informed of the timetable for my repairs and even though my vehicle had the worst case scenario (Fuel pump), it was easy to be impressed with the detail-oriented mechanics (calling all over for best price on parts and breaking car talk down to the basics), friendly front-desk people and long-time customers who keep coming back which now includes me.", "type": "review", "business_id": "osI3BT6AagWA-ravXrmK3w"}

Grand in both scope and spectacle with ornate glass, open floorplans, and plush seating complimented by a staff of over twelve-dozen overseeing preparation, service, and customer needs my arrival at Bacchanal shortly preceded its 8am opening and greeted first by a cheerful cashier, then by assistant manager Stephanie, my experience commenced; the subsequent three hours adrift in 70+ of the buffet's offerings and a sea of smiles emanating from each employee and nearly every patron.  Divided into several sections with many offering cooked-to-order options including crepes and omelets it was Asian that my meal began and with fresh steamer baskets just opened the dim sum excelled - a small quibble in the thick-skinned har gow more than compensated by bao, duck and pork as good as that at Jasmine plus full-service congee complete with century egg, not to mention Sin City's best Egg Custard Tart later discovered at the dessert island.  Moving next to things more \"American,\" one is well advised to monitor for items fresh from the kitchen as both the crunchy waffles and well seasoned chicken proved superlative while later tastes of waffle fries and tots fell flat - a fresh buttermilk biscuit, hot seafood preparations, and sliced meats including smoky beef ribs with caramelized crunch all showing far better.  At times a touch liberal in salt with Kung Pao Chicken and Risotto suffering the most, Bacchanal again shines in selections of shellfish, cheese, and charcuterie but with much eating to do and such things widely available elsewhere it was thoroughly in my sweet tooth that I indulged and although I passed up a few cookies plus a duo of sorbet suffice it to say that I nearly ran the gamut; cakes, doughnuts, pies, tarts, and more all justifying the calories with the aforementioned egg custard, pecan pie, cream puff, carrot cake, and citrus 'tiramisu' all warranting special mention along with the lovely pastry team who jovially tended to baking, saucing, arranging, and making crepes at a pace seldom to lull.\n\nSlightly more expensive than Wicked Spoon but making up the difference in complimentary champagne there are things to love about both of Las Vegas' premier all-you-can-eat experiences yet aside from a more expansive gelato case and my predilection to The Cosmopolitan's soundtrack I'd be hard-pressed to ever recommend it over Bacchanal.  Obviously limited by the constraints intrinsic to feeding anywhere from 2500 to 4500 persons in a given day yet defying the odds through a combination of remarkable customer service and striking attention to detail I'm happy to say that Bacchanal lives up to the liberally applied superlatives and although \"Gods\" may require something slightly more refined I'm almost positive they won't find it in such a format for less than $50, especially on Las Vegas Boulevard.", "type": "review", "business_id": "sIyHTizqAiGu12XMLX3N3g"}

My previous review stated a long wait between rolls. This is getting better though may be because it was very slow in the place( I was only customer). The same chef is still there and that is a good thing, he is very clean and the sushi is perfectly presented. I will return at night and see if it got any faster for getting order. Overall still the best place yet to eat sushi around this area.\nAfter getting the check, I noticed that I was charged 5.00 for the crunch roll that was advertised for 4.00 on the happy hour menu and I notified the waitress and was told that the price was raised by the owner and only he could adjust the price. I pulled up the happy hour menu from the web site, that was  just updated a week ago, and showed her the menu. She said \"I NOT GOWIN CHANGE CAUSE OWNER NO HERE\". I pointed out my dissatisfaction about the advertised price and also pointed out it was the principal of the situation and that she should honor the price advertised. She told me to talk to the owner next time you come in and he fix. This happened once before after I ate there every day for over a month and all of a sudden I was being charged the incorrect price and ran across the same attitude. I quit going there for over 6 months due to that. This is the second time going back after that and I am once again going to stop going there as a penalty for the attitude. I was treated as if I was not appreciated and felt I was not important enough to be treated as a person but as I was trying to cheat them out of a dollar.

The last mile or so of the Great Allegheny Passage Trail has been completed!  You no longer have to try and bypass the area around Sandcastle.  For the first time, a complete trail ride from Pittsburgh to Cumberland is now possible.  Actually, if you're really ambitious you can connect in Cumberland to the C&O Canal Path, you could ride uninterrupted to the National Mall in Washington, DC.\n\nHmm, do I sense a challenge here?  Perhaps a vacation idea for me and my husband Rick?\n\nWell my first ride on the new segment was considerably less grandiose.  I rode from my house in Squirrel Hill via Schenley Park, the Panther Hollow Trail, the Eliza Furnace Trail, the Hot Metal Bridge, and the South Side Trail (which is part of the GAP Trail) to Homestead--a distance of about 9 miles.  I would have liked to have gone down to McKeesport, but it was just a little hot out-not too bad though- and I didn't want to overdo it.  I brought extra water and I rode at a reduced pace.\n\nAs I rode through the new segment I  thought, \"It doesn't get any better than this\".  I thought of all the years of hard work, all of the trail groups coming together, and all of the money wisely invested in this tremendous public asset.  It was well worth the wait.\n\nOh, my bike and I road the bus home from Homestead.  It was after all a very warm day.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Mn0raEZFnqbSss2KBjRaiA"}

I tend to have a higher appreciation of dishes that are conceived using ingredients commonly discarded or overlooked rather than the high end stuff.   Having read multiple stellar reviews and even with a separate sign outside the restaurant that simply says in all caps BUN BO HUE, it seems I had no choice but to sample their pho de resistance (a French-Vietnamese pun seems appropriate).\n\nIn the sitcom How I Met Your Mother, the main character Ted Moseby describes the impression that he makes on girls in the form of songs on the radio....\"I'm not some easily digested top 40 pop song, I'm complex and require multiple listens... I'm Stairway to Heaven\"  Whereas beef and chicken pho are the top 40 hits of Vietnamese noodle soups, I feel that Bun Bo Hue is Stairway to Heaven requiring multiple tastings to discover new things to appreciate with each delicious bite.\n\nA subtle yet rich beef/pork broth with deep notes of lemongrass and just the right touch of spice, the soup uses round chewy rice noodles akin to bucatini as opposed to the linguini-like counterpart in traditional pho.  There are also various pieces of pork feet, pork bloodcake, steamed pork loaf, and beef shank and tendon.  Further complexity is provided with vietnamese coriander, mint and some vietnamese herbs that escape my recollection.  Finally, a fresh plate of colorful purple and green cabbage along with jullienned herbs and wedges of lime add bright notes of texture and tartness to complete the dish.   The beauty of the dish is how each component is distinct yet not overpowering so that every tasty bite is a unique experience on their own.  Of the various bun bo hue I've sampled, this one definitely ranks up with the best since none of the meat components including the pork blood cubes are overcooked (a common mistake) and the meat around the pork knuckle is particularly tender and flavorful.  \n\nWhereas some dishes will elicit a party in your mouth, this one will be a symphony in your mouth that strike all the right notes and may require or compel multiple tastings.

Of course, everyone loves the dinosaurs, too!  :)\n\nThe museum has added a lot of interactive exhibits since I've been.

There is a new interactive exhibit all about Light & Color, which had a lot of fun science-related activities.  We especially enjoyed the \"glow-in-the-dark\" room!  :)  \n\nAnother new feature is a room filled with books, puzzles, and hands-on science activities.  We spent a while here, as well, playing with magnets and puzzles.  We could have spent longer, but we had already been at the museum for 2 1/2 hours!  \n\nAll in all, for a small museum, this is a great way to spend a hot summer day in Mesa.

I got to spend last weekend here in honor of the infamous Gabi K's (ahem, I mean Gabi M) wedding. And this gorgeous hotel is quite fitting for the wedding of a Yelp \"celebrity.\"  \n\nMy husband and I checked in late on a Friday night and the only rooms left were suites....and so we were upgraded to a magnificent suite overlooking the adult pool and Camelback Mountain.  I know, you're feeling real sorry for us right now. ;)  Our suite was HUGE with a separate living room, bathroom fit for a queen, a balcony the size of my bedroom back home, and 2 flat screen TVS.  After some fiddling with the TV we discovered they had tivo, which meant my husband could tivo the Northwestern game while we enjoyed hiking Camelback the next morning. Phew- the weather was too nice to stay inside watching TV!\n\nThe resort was just as heavenly outside of our suite: an adult pool, a noisy pool for those of you with kiddies, delicious food, incredible workout facility including spinning classes, and a $32 million dollar spa.  I had thought about booking a couples massage before my trip, but my husband suggested we hold off since we've been going thru lots of dough lately. . After one look at the spa he asked me when we'd be indulging in our couples massage and I reminded him of our plan to save money.  His response \"when have you ever listened to me in the past?\" Next time I'll definitely be booking that massage, although this time I did get to enjoy a blissful shower in the spa. \n\nGabi's wedding was absolutely perfect.  The ceremony took place on the Valencia lawn with a breathtaking view of the mountain and then we moved inside the Valencia ballroom for dinner and dancing.  The neutral colored ballroom looked lovely with the beautiful fall colored flowers Gabi chose.\n\nThe suite, facilities, and wedding were worthy of a 5 star review. So why the 4 stars? The resort seemed to be a bit short staffed over the weekend and the service at the pool, restaurant and throughout the resort was very slllloooowwww.   Wait 30 minutes for an Arnold Palmer slow.   I was surprised they didn't have more people working knowing there was a celebrity wedding there over the weekend. ;)", "type": "review", "business_id": "qt_GH5ZBn6xT0CtzNdrvyQ"}

I ordered an Americano and the lady operating the espresso machine (I can't call her a barista as it was obvious she's had no training) didn't tamp the espresso. I asked, and she said \"we don't do that\", which I found odd. I mean, isn't that just coffee if you don't tamp the espresso? Now I was only a barista for 2 years in college, so I'm no expert, so I asked facebook. Here were the responses:\n\"If you don't tamp you're making drip coffee...\"\n\"Espresso is made by forcing very hot water under high pressure through finely ground, compacted coffee. Tamping down the coffee promotes the water's even penetration of the grounds.\"\n\"Your espresso should be tamped;-)!\"\n\"If you're gonna make it without tamping go ahead and call it expresso...because it's faster and you clearly don't know what you're doing.\"\nMy conclusion was that espresso should be tamped so I'll be driving out of my way to Echo coffee until the folks at Buzzberry learn to tamp their espresso.\n\n*I gave an extra star because their cinnamon roll is really good, but I don't know if they actually make them or purchase them.*", "type": "review", "business_id": "6OWD5dGw9aJ6PNI2hNOP5w"}

It's not about the money, but it helped that they offered a special \"pocket pet\" price, which another crematorium refused to do since they were technically cats- it would have been twice the price there, and after the money spent trying to save them, I was pretty strapped. \n\nThe person who helped me the first time was my favorite, a really nice guy with a mustache who humored my rambling and crying, because I was almost hysterical. The owner helped me with the last two kittens today while I was much calmer, and he was also very courteous. I wish there was a nicer place to sit with the animals for a few minutes beforehand, but most people probably do that at home. The \"lobby\" is just gray floors and white walls, empty. The office is ok, it has the only chairs you can sit in, but I was told I wasn't allowed to sit in there and taken into the loud warehouse where I believe they have all the freezers and cremation equipment (hidden behind a screen) to spend a last moment with my kittens.\n\nLong story short, I would go back again, and I'm sure I will be back, but I will make sure I'm 100% ready to say goodbye first.\n\nUPDATE: I am incredibly disappointed. Left a message after business hours the night of 10/16 after dropping off my kittens that morning, asking if I could get the remains back to take them to my vet to make a pawprint, with plans to bring them back to be cremated (I had regrets that I hadn't done that with the first kitten). I expected a call back Saturday, but it's now 8 pm on Monday night, it's been 3 days, and nobody bothered to call me back- if they are on call on the weekends they should have been checking the messages, and they had all day today to call me as well. I'm sure it is far too late now, and I even mentioned in my message that if it was already too late I would understand, but they still should have called me back as per my request.

This was the third time we'd come for one, as previous experiences were very good. Tonight's was far off the mark. \n\nFirst, they shifted us over to the Kazimierz bar, as they apparently booked two events for the same night. Second, they changed the menu from what was published. The first two courses were made up last minute. Third, the food was cold. Fourth, service was slow. Fifth, the food was not good. Sixth, since this event was focused on wine, I thought it cheap that on the last course they served us the same cheap wine they had given us on the first course. \n\nLastly, they had the audacity to automatically add a 20% gratuity before handing me the bill. This after I had decided the gratuity would be minimal. American Express and I will have a little conversation about that one.\n\nSorry Cowboy Ciao, we're done giving you our business.

Excellent for beginners, fitness buffs, or visitors looking for a good view. The trail is 1.75 miles each way, and the signs suggest allowing 2 hours to complete it. The trail is not a loop, and consists of two summits. The first summit is Pinnacle Peak itself, with 1/2 mile leading up to the Grand View. The highest point of the trail is just before the 3/4 mile mark. Just before the one mile marker is the Owl's Rest, a nice stone circular seating area that offers great views of the Valley. The trail up and down the second summit is only 3/4 of a mile, but it is much steeper. The first summit can be completed by people of all fitness levels and offers some of the best views, while the second summit is better for those looking for a cardio workout.\n\nI recently moved to the area and started hiking the trail last month. With little to no prior hiking experience, my first trip was a challenge. We went on a Saturday around 9 am when temperatures were in the mid-80s. I took the first part of the trail too quickly and had to take a long break on the way back from the second summit. Despite struggling, we finished the hike in 1 hour and 50 minutes. Since then, I have hiked Pinnacle 4 more times, on both weekdays and weekends. With enough water and short breaks, I have been able to complete the hike in under an hour and 30 minutes. \n\nMost people I encounter on the trail have been friendly and respectful, with the occasional runner speeding by with no warning. I have also seen a few runners take a tumble, so please be careful! The terrain throughout is mostly smooth but there are some rockier parts so trail runners/light hiking shoes may be helpful.\n\nThe trailhead facilities are very well-maintained, and offer restrooms, water fountains, and trail information. In addition, there are volunteers who walk the trail each day offering water. Parking can be a problem, but I have gone at peak times and still been able to find a space in the lot itself.\n\nAdvice for locals: go after a rainstorm. The views are spectacular and the air smells wonderful. I went on a Saturday morning around 7:30 am and braved the 40 degree weather. I saw less than 10 other people and enjoyed some tranquility on the usually crowded trail.", "type": "review", "business_id": "wjnqiWyMtZ7G_267lkwOng"}

I went with my sister and sat at the sushi bar. The service was friendly enough, I guess. Once the chef and the teenage guy working there saw two cute teenage girls walk in, our side of the bar no longer existed, and a girl from the back came out to bring us our rolls. No refills on drinks, and had to ask for the check. I honestly don't think one of the guys checked on us after those girls walked in. it was pretty bad.\n\nOnto the food... The cucumber salad was really good and the portion was larger than other sushi places, but it also cost 4.00. for cucumber salad. Miso soup was standard run of the mill miso soup. My avocado roll had a tiny sliver of green in the middle and thats it. Even though it only cost 4.00, I still felt kind of scammed. My sister said her spicy salmon roll was just okay, it was finely diced salmon in rice with a huge wallop of sriracha on top. I'm not sure I wouldve trusted the fish from this place anyway, so I'm glad I stuck with an avocado roll. :X drinks cost 2.75, for kind of tasteless iced green tea, which is okay if you get refills, but when you don't, it's kind of like saying \"bite the pillow, it's going in dry.\"\n\nI won't be back, but at least I can say I tried it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "AeuSMT-IX9fl4qNUEU1abQ"}

The. You will be treated like crap for asking questions as if you interrupted a family dinner.\n\nOnce you have those other range privileges, you will not be given ANY direction or expectations. You will, however, be screamed at by a rude RO for an arbitrary infraction - case in point - I was sighting in my pistol at about 9 yards. I was using a target stand that was on the ground already, instead of the ones buried in the dirt. An RO came over and freaked out and made me feel like I was shooting at other people and how I was supposed to know I was not allowed to do that. #1 Why was the stand there then? #2 Why was I not given ANY information at all? #3 Why at the rimfire match which qualified me ON THAT RANGE was a repeatedly engaging targets as close as 5 YARDS??? \n\nNo one responds to their emails. Each division has a director who you are supposed to be able to contact. I have never ONCE received a reply to a question regarding procedure, rules, etc.\n\nI get it that these guys must get frustrated dealing with dummies who don't listen, like seriously, \"Don't touch guns during ceasefire\" is pretty easy to understand but EVERY single time some idiot gets yelled at. However, this is the job you chose. Do not take it out on me, and do not treat me like a bother. You are not the only game in town.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qgNlUte2tSI7OufuuvR8DA"}

They were thoughtful enough to mention to our server that I would be looking for Vegetarian eats, so I was given the allergy binder (yeah, no information for Vegetarians, just FYI).\n\nI ordered the Bacon Guacamole Burger with a substitution of a Gardenburger\u00ae and removed the bacon and mayo. I did indulge in the bottomless fries, but was really disappointed that you're given less than ten fries to start. Seriously? I know it's unlimited, but give people a nice amount and maybe you won't have multiple orders of more fries. Our server was really great though and I asked her to bring us more as soon as we got our orders (this took a while, but like I mentioned, it was busy). I liked the Gardenburger\u00ae (first time trying it, but I had done research between this and Boca Burgers; I like the idea of vegetables in a patty form rather than soy meat) and the guacamole was okay. There was barely any flavor and the vegetables were blah (the shredded lettuce was sad). The bun was all right, a tad dry. Overall, not pleased. The fries were disappointing too! I remember them being so much better too. I know they're probably just from a frozen bag, but it was not cooked well (WAY too oily) and the Red Robin Seasoning I remember enjoying was just meh too. Anyway, I thought maybe I didn't enjoy my burger since it was a \"healthy\" version, however, I took a bite of Ruben's Burnin' Love Burger and it was just okay. He, not being as picky as I am, thought everything was just okay as well.\n\nMy verdict? That was my last time dining there.

I made the mistake once of going during the lunch rush and never got a cup for my water (there are self serve water carafes on each table), had to get my own silverware and got my starter soup and egg roll after my meal came. Service was friendly but you could tell the wait staff was stressed, making it  all very weird and uncomfortable. But.  If you come during the off hours, service is quick, attentive and friendly without the anxiety. \n\nLunch specials are cheap ($8-10) but so quality and delicious. Lunch comes with a starter soup (tofu cubes, veggies and a kind of palate cleansing broth) and an egg roll. I've had the pad see ew with beef which is my baseline dish for Thai restaurants. If a Thai restaurant flops on that dish I probably won't be back. Nunthaporn's does it well with the perfect mixture of wide noodles, addictively cracky sauce and just enough meat to make you feel like you're getting more than your money's worth. The only thing I wish they'd change is using Chinese broccoli instead of regular broccoli but I'd definitely get it again. Their curries are on point, but my favorite is the green which really brings the spicy. Speaking of spice, it appears they don't use the usual 1-10 spice level gauge. All of my dishes have been moderately spicy and I've never been asked how hot I like my food. Maybe they just saw the spicy food champion inside of me without me having to say anything. That being said, if you're sensitive to spicy food you may want to let them know to knock down the spice level for you. \n\nAll of their lunch dishes could easily make two meals and I often end up taking half back to work and having it for lunch the next day. \n\nThis is easily in my top 5 favorite lunch spots in the area!", "type": "review", "business_id": "IkSF5GEHcl7DePGlXksl5A"}

Not only is it  very local and in an area completely off the strip/ Chinatown.. it's got amazing food, good atmosphere to socialize in and one of the chillest interior designs off all Korean restaurants in Las Vegas. \n\nAs far as the menu goes, everything there is surprisingly very reasonably priced and cheap. They have a section called \"casseroles\" in which you can order from a wide range of spicy soup. Two people can share for only $20! The servers will actually bring out the portable stove for you too so that your soup is guaranteed hot at all times. This applies the same for their tapas and certain grilled/ fried dishes. \n\nIf you get the casserole dish, GET THE SEAFOOD COMBO!! *DROOLS* It is so delicious and smells like fresh seafood by the bay. On top of having a large amount of vegetables, different types of mushrooms and udon noodle, they also put a GENEROUS amount of seafood in the soup. It  includes baby octopus, squid, fish cakes, mussels, clams, shrimp AND soft shell crab. (If this helps, the broth is similar to the Korean spicy kimchi flavored ramen you find at the Asian supermarket, yet with a more natural taste, instead of all of the msg)\n\nNow Soyo is not a very large restaurant. It sits about 45 people max capacity, and has roughly 12-15 tables to dine in (mostly larger tables). The ambiance of Soyo is very relaxed, extremely laid back with good 90's hip hop/ dance music  and the occasional k pop playing in the background.. The lighting there is also dim, with a blueish kind of hue that gives off a very mellow vibe.. almost as if you were dining in some alleyway at 3 AM in Korea where the only lighting you got was from the street lamps (imagine Korean dramas lol). It's definitely the place to go to if you just want to enjoy good company, good alcohol and good food. I definitely recommend this place, especially if you go there for a date. Ask to sit in their cute little nook like caved in booths that are directly mounted into the walls (sort of like private rooms).

The beverages were superbly prepared and decorated and the appetizers, side items, main courses and desserts were all eclectic, astonishing and delicious.  With that said, the problems with my experience started from the moment I sat down.  As I scanned thru the food menu, drinks menu and prices, our waiter sidled up and announced the specials.  He was not very personable and seemed unconcerned that we had chosen this restaurant to dine in for the evening. Understanding that some people can lack in some areas but make it up in others, I left my thoughts aside and decided to enjoy my dining experience.  The second setback arrived when I placed my wine order.  The waiter had no idea which wine I selected, even though I also pointed to it in the wine menu.  Eventually he returned with multiple bottles for me to choose from.  This took a lot longer than it should have for me to order a bottle of wine and was very unprofessional, especially considering how high the prices are.  The waiter then left the table and did not open the bottle in front of us.  I ordered a $90 half bottle of wine and I could see the waiter 20 feet away from us, with his back to our table, haggling with this bottle of wine.  When he finally returned to the table, I was over it.  The support staff were all amazing, helpful and smiling, however, our waiter never cracked a smile.  He seemed unskilled and miserable.  When we finished our meal we made him aware that we would have dessert but needed some time to relax.  After dessert he eagerly brought us our bill.  I have been made aware of a couple of service features of Strip Steak since this experience which have maddened me further.  After a meal, there is a complimentary bag of Chocolate Kettle Corn presented to the guests.  We were not made aware of this kind gesture because our waiter was in a hurry to have us leave the restaurant.  Also, I am a local now, which I revealed to our waiter, and I am told that Strip Steak carries a locals menu, although he was not concerned enough to present one to us.  Our bill was over $500 for three people and even though gratuity was added, it was not deserved.  I will always tip wait staff in any situation, but when that situation is a negative one I tend to never return to the restaurant again.  If you are like me when it comes to good professional service, I would suggest you skip this restaurant as well.  On a side note, a female member of our party visited the restroom facilities, which are unisex, and she walked in on a gentleman who had not locked the door.  She was very embarrassed by this and mentioned it to our waiter.  He seemed offended that we had an issue with the restroom policy of the restaurant and acted as if it were our problem.  Our only suggestion was that they have a dedicated woman's restroom and that others could remain unisex.", "type": "review", "business_id": "XDYnLQC8ViZejuCDp4eCwg"}

Drink prices were decent (2.50 bud products.. my huge blue moon was $6 but was comped for playing video poker). The best part? The food! I was very impressed. This is just bar food people, so no it doesn't compare to a nice steak dinner.. but for bar food it rocked. $16.99 for a bucket of DELISH sliders (10 to a bucket.. with cheese, on yummy buns) or $16.99 for a bucket of wings. Best part about the wings? You can get them bone in, bone out, or chicken finger style. You can also get up to 3 sauces in your bucket (tons to choose from). The General Tso boneless was awesome.. kind of what Chinese food General Tso should be (white meat, yummy sauce.. no scary bites of \"what the hell is this\" meat). The Gold Rush sauce was also a pleasant surprise.. perfect mix of BBQ and Buffalo flavors.. yum!\n\n3 of us attempted to split the slider bucket and wing bucket but we had tons left over. 4-6 pople could comfortably dine here on less than $35. Not bad! \n\nTrying to find a reason to fault this place, but can't think of anything.. honestly. Oh, and as a side note.. this appears to be a Steelers hangout on Sundays. It was awesome for us this particular week as we were betting on the Steelers and the Steelers won! However..

The ribs were dry, no moisture in there meat at all.   The macaroni and cheese was also dry.

I love Roberto's food and they are always generous with their portions.  My favorites are the unbelieveably savory rolled beef tacos (always with Guacamole and cheese), fish tacos, carne asada chimichangas, carnitas nachos and even chips with guacamole and cheese.  The drive thru is open 24 hours, so it's probably the best and cheapest after-gambling or clubbing food around!\n\nAs a frequent visitor to Vegas, sometimes you start to hate/dread the strip and just want something cheap (why not?) simple and fast ...you get all this and so much more!!!\n\nPS... OK, I'll share a funny story regarding the rolled tacos... I ordered them through the drive thru and was so hungry, I couldn't wait to get home and started eating them in the car.  I had no idea I was dripping sauce, guacamole and cheese on myself.  Before I got home, I had to stop off at a drugstore to pick up a few things.  I distinctly remember the guy at the checkout having a funny look on his face and never really making eye contact with me.  I just brushed it off and hurried back in the car when I saw my reflection on the store glass - my shirt looked like an art canvas of green, orange and red!! I can't imagine what the checker thought... maybe one too many martinis... Geez...at that point I just laughed and cleaned myself up!", "type": "review", "business_id": "Snvt71a7KDWYxeltag2zLA"}

I'd definitely order these again.\n\nI had the chicken chimichanga.  I was not as pleased with my dish, thus the 3 stars for the food.  It was dry in the interior of the chimichanga.  I did love the rice and beans, perhaps the best Mexican/Spanish rice I've had a Mexican restaurant like this.\n\nMy son had the cheese quesadilla (which they call a cheese crisp) and French fries.  He liked both, but didn't finish either, which is par for the course since he's 3.  They were very understanding of us having a small child, they brought him an extra set of silverware and watered down his apple juice, as we requested.  \n\nI'll definitely return, it's an old school place with simple, but good food.  I will say I like won't get the chicken chimichanga again, I think I'll definitely get some enchiladas next time.", "type": "review", "business_id": "btuXBnJEIkn7ax2TfvHQyw"}

My guess is their board of directors is going in two different directions.  One is the aging group of major donors who are responsible for everything on teh west side of the museum...all the stuff that was probably there since the 70s at least. Taxidermied animals, aging interpretive texts on both natural historical features and native populations in early Nevada history.\n\nThen this museum has some very dynamic and new blood pumping through its veins with terrific and innovative interpretation!  I LOVED the bit on Vegas being a 24 hour city, and they had many interesting interactive ways of expressing the oral history collections and artifacts.  I also liked, in the fossil room, the stations to do crayon rubbings of the various skeletal specimens they have. \n\nThis museum also has numerous rooms that have VERY comfortable, almost living room like accomodations to view videos on their topics.  They included these in the Bats exhibition as well as the 24 City and historical exhibits.  Great ideas, a lot of which I'll be brining home to my own museum. \n\nI definately can't wait until my next visit to Vegas so I can share this hidden gem with my family and friends, and to have more time to look around and see what I missed this time around!", "type": "review", "business_id": "erv9dJX2BGgNMy8OZZqHEg"}

Growing up in the Midwest, United States, I spent most of my life deprived of mountainous regions. Before we even arrived to the city, I was determined to climb my first mountain - Mont Royal.\n After experiencing a few days of the city, we made the venture from our hotel in Longueuil to the park (after a brief stop for meat pies at Tourtiere Australienne! YUM!!). Never one to follow conventional wisdom, (or previously marked trails, for that matter) I - the trail guide for the day - decided to bush-wack our way up the side of the mountain. About half-way up, without a trail in sight, we realize that we've gotten ourselves into a bit of a situation. Above us was steep, crumbly dirt that was still wet from the rain from the last couple days. Below us was a slightly less steep drop, but jagged rocks, broken glass bottles, the few trees we'd been using to pull ourselves up, and just as much crumbly ground. With no choice at that point but to continue on, we scaled the side of the mountain by digging into the dirt until we finally found a path to continue on to.\n From the grounds around Chalet du Mont-Royal, you can see the whole city spread out in all of it's glory below you. We arrived just before dusk, so we had the immediate transition from the sunny scenery, to the rosy glow lending its light to the vista below.\n  We found our way in the quickly departing light to the Croix du Mont-Royal - the peak of the mountain, and while I was busy taking pictures of the cross at night, my boyfriend was rummaging through his bag. I turned around to see what he thought of the view as he was getting down on his knee with a small box in his hand. He asked if I would climb more mountains with him, then he asked me to marry him!\n  The Parc du Mont-Royal, and its namesake mountain will always hold a special place in my heart, but even if you don't have the same sentimental experience, it's still a great place to see!", "type": "review", "business_id": "pdV1tu4HOrCOcekk8pC39g"}

Oops!\n\nThe last time I visited Cafe Boa, they were in a tiny location on the other side of Mill, and most of the seating consisted of small tables on an even smaller patio.\n\nI visited Cafe Boa with a new friend with the express purpose of chatting and drinking some wine, since wine is usually serves well as a conversational lubricant. As it turns out, no lubrication was necessary, but the wine was sure fine! We ordered the pitcher of red Sangria, which during happy hour is $15.\n\nThe waiter brought out a giant pitcher already half filled with fanta (!), some liqueur, and sliced apples, oranges, limes, grapes, and frankly who knows what else was lurking in it's depths. Then, he proceeded to open a bottle of wine, pour it in, and mix it up.\n\nThe end result was superb! Not too sweet as some Sangria can be, not too much liqueur to mask the taste of the wine. It was light, refreshing, tasty, and very buzz inducing. I think I might have said a few times, \"Woah I am fucked up.\" Or maybe I just thought it. Hard to say. I'm a big guy, but kind of a lightweight when it comes to drinking.\n\nWe ordered the Bruschetta, which was fantastic. The bread was delicious, the tomatoes were fresh and tasty and smelled like tomatoes, always a good sign, and there was plenty of garlic - but after drinking a pitcher of Sangria, who cares about garlic breath, really?\n\nWe ordered a side of olives as well... They were mediocre. OK, they kind of sucked, but we ate them anyway. The green ones were semi-flavorless. The kalamata were eh. Given their focus on freshly prepared food, I was surprised that they'd serve these olives.\n\nThe service was decent, the price was reasonable, and the wine was fiiiiine. So is my friend, but I'm reviewing Cafe Boa here, so I'm going to try to stay on topic.\n\nFrom the other reviews, it sounds like the pasta dishes are not what they once were. The bruschetta was awesome. I probably wouldn't come here for dinner, unless dinner consisted of some appetizer menu items and getting liquored up. The cheese plate looked promising... Perhaps next time! As Gen. McArthur said... I will return! Only I'll do it with my thirst, and not a huge naval armada.\n\nSpeaking of McArthur, here's a logistical note:\n\nIf you go during the week.... Parking is for crap. All the parking meters are 80 mins max.... Parking is free after 4, but that leaves you a 40 minute gap from when your meter expires until parking is free.", "type": "review", "business_id": "iNT6pcUugoXsDlZgRTyhtw"}

I don't know if it's the sprout or the dressing, but it is one of the best cobb salads I have ever had. \n     And the garabge burger....Mmmmmmm.

I don't know what genuis started the egg on a burger trend, but kudos to you!\nBut that's not all. Imagine a Primanti's sandwich but with a big, fat burger. It has fries, cole slaw, an egg and American cheese. My BF often comments it's strange there's no bacon, but honestly, that'd be over kill. \n\nThey also have a really good veggie sandwich with Hummus (I don't remember the name), a great buffalo chicken sandwich and fantastic appitizers. \n\nAlso, it's worth mentioning they hace really good hand cut fries- not those mushy frozen crap sticks- and GREAT fresh homemade potato chips. \n\nNow, as far as the ribs and wings go, I'm not a big ribs/wings person. I can appreciate that they're good, but I wouldn't order it much.

We arrived around 10 am and we were Finally seated around 1045. only 20 mins past the given wait time, and without even an \"I'm so sorry the wait will be longer then expected\" or even a general nod in our direction.

I had one bite of my burrito and my mouth was on fire. if there was flavor it was masked by the intense amount of spices that were bombarding my taste buds. My girlfriends hash browns was more like wet mush in a ring, and the scramble was almost too much on the wet side for the eggs to have been cooked all the way thru. Too bad our server was also MIA yet again during our ENTIRE MEAL. I would have liked to have tried something I could actually eat considering my stomach was probably growling loud enough for our neighboring table to hear (even over the blaringly loud club dance music they were playing).\n\nTHE SERVICE\nI work in the F&B industry and have been a proud provider of excellent customer service for 15 years ( so I do sorta know what Im talking about, not saying Im the best.... I just understand what makes a complete experience) well we definatly got an experience alright. \nOur service LACKED every quality of a good experience. \n1)Drink orders were taken 5-12 mins after being seated. \n2)we had top flag down our server after being sat for almost 20 mins to have our food order taken\n3)NOT ONCE did the server stop by, after getting us the required condiments we had asked for in our food order, to see if our food was even to our liking!!!!! that is ELEMENTRY!!!! my plate was pushed to the side with one bite taken out with a napkin on top of it for close to 38 mins before our server returned.\n4) SHE DIDNT EVEN ACKNOLEDGE the uneaten food when she did return\n5) When the server was informed that the food was inediable she had the manager take care of it..... funny the manager didn't stop by.\n\nZero Stars for: Service was POOR and SLOW (the girl she was training was more attentive to the tables)\nZero Stars for: The Food well they would probably get more stars if I had even been able to try any of it. \n\nThey do get one star however for D\u00e9cor and Such, this place is super HIP and FUNKY with round booths and an open air concept.

We were completely taken by surprise when we discovered this gem last night. We sat at the sushi bar and asked the sushi chefs to surprise us. Surprise us they did with a roll called Osaka Chef Special, (which is what they were experimenting with at the time) and were treated to a fantastic spicey roll that was not only amazing to look at, but extremely clean, tight, and masterly put together. As we kept ordering, we found out that the head sushi chef was a 10 year vet out of some of the best houses in NYC, and basically brought those same items to Osaka's and was busy training the other oriental chefs. Impressive. Besides the killer sushi, the place looks very sharp inside from modern flooring and wood ceilings, to stacked stone wall accents. Very cool decor.

That sign is perfect for the outdoor patio at Park. \n\nI love Park! It's another one of the finds in Vegas that gives me a feeling of being back at home in Columbus (OH)! Some may describe it has \"Hipster\" - and rightfully so... just don't grab from that, that it's Snobby Hipster. Park on Fremont is the approachable Hipster. The Hipster with an Android phone. The Hipster that doesn't quite commit to riding bicycles EVERYWHERE and sometimes grabs an Uber. \n\nPark is pretty small inside, so plan to venture outdoors as there is plenty of outdoor seating. But if you sit inside, avoid that back booth, unless you've got really small thighs. I mean REALLY small thighs. My friends and I once sat in that back booth and we had a hard time getting in/out. The bar is pretty cool though and the bartenders all seem pretty cool as well. \n\nMy favorite thing about Park, aside from the chicken and waffle sandwich, is the secret garden in the back... so be sure to explore your surroundings! \n\nI've ordered a cheeseburger and fries, chicken and waffle sandwich and wings and fries. Park has some of the best French fries! They're always the right amount of crisp. The cheeseburger was pretty standard, but the wings I had ordered really surprised me. The Chipotle BBQ sauce that they used is really good! Not too much of a kick but just enough to leave you wanting more. \n\nMy absolute FAVORITE dish there though is the Chicken and Waffle sandwich. It's pretty big so bring your appetite if you're going to be ordering this dish. There is a fried chicken breast nestled between two waffles and some bacon. The chicken is the perfect amount of crispy and juicy. You also get syrup which makes the waffle easier to bite into. You have your choice of a side, I've (so far) gotten it with a salad and sweet potato tots. Go with the tots, they're pretty darn good as well! \n\nPark has an awesome (brunch) drink special - $20 for a bottle of champagne and enough orange juice to make quite a few mimosas out of. So if you're looking for a downtown brunch spot to drink, go to Park!", "type": "review", "business_id": "itFwrNtjrQL5NPMYTeD44g"}

Chas Roberts was the installer for the AC/Heating unit in our new home. We have lived in our house less than two years and at just a little over one year some component, I don't remember which, malfunctioned and was causing the unit to turn on and off repeatedly in short amounts of time. There was no problem with this repair. The technician was friendly, professional, and the repair was done in minutes. The discussion of money never took place and I didn't pay anything for the repair. I assumed this was due to the fact that they stood behind the quality of their installation and realized that my unit is too new to be having any problems. My next experience with Chas Roberts, however, was less than professional and ended with me feeling infuriated.\n\nAbout the beginning of December I noticed that my unit was making a loud whirring noise every time it turned on and would also shut off and turn back on seconds later. I finally had the time to call about the problem and called my home builder since that is who I called the last time I had an issue. They called me later in the evening around 6:45, said that someone could be out to look at it tonight no later than nine, and that the technician would call me when they were on their way. Around 7:30, the technician calls to inform me he is on his way and should be to my home in about a half hour. The technician arrived and was friendly and professional when he introduced himself. I told him to walk around the side of the house and I would let him through the side gate to look at the unit. I described the problem we are having to him and he asked me to turn the unit on. I turned the unit on and he said that it sounded like the motor bearings were going out and that he wanted to let the unit run for about 10 minutes to see how it sounded. After about 10 minutes he shows me some electrical readings he took, states that the numbers were low and that is an indication that the motor bearings are going out. He proceeds to tell me he can order the part and be out either tomorrow or Thursday to do the install and that the whole job was going to cost me somewhere around $508. I advised him that I should still have a warranty on most of the unit since it was less than two years old and the warranty is longer than that. He called his \"dispatcher\" to verify that my unit was still under warranty but then tells me it's a parts warranty that does not cover labor. My first thought was, OK, how much could that be? He then tells me the job would cost somewhere around $350 and that I would have to pay him an $85 deposit. I tell him I don't have cash on me and I don't write checks so I couldn't do it this evening. He then offered to process a credit card which, at first, I agreed to because I really want to get the problem fixed but then moments later changed my mind, told him I didn't want to do anything without talking to my wife first, and offered to call him tomorrow.\n\nFrom here, the experience went drastically south and the conversation takes place at my Arcadia door with the technician leaning into my home. After telling him I needed to speak to my wife first he tells me that he still has to collect $85 dollars because this was a service call. I told him that I was never informed that I would be charged for the visit and was under the impression that no costs were explicitly stated to me because the unit is still under warranty. He then apologizes and says that sometimes when you go through a third party (the builder) they don't always notify you that you can be charged. I then told him I don't see how that's their responsibility since he called me to confirm he was coming to look at my unit and should have explicitly stated any costs that I could incur before coming to asses the problem. He stated that he couldn't do that because he has a chart that shows him what jobs cost what amount and he couldn't immediately say if this would be a service call. I told him, OK, but I don't have your cost chart so I had no way of knowing this would be an $85 dollar service call. He then stated that he still needed to collect $85 regardless. I then took a very, very deep breath and said, \"I hope you can understand why I am getting very angry right now.\" He apologized and said there was nothing he could do and that he has to charge me for a service call. I then stated, \"So you expect people pay $85 they didn't know they were going to have to pay because you failed to relay the cost to them?\" He again stated that's the price of the service call and I finally just said, \"Well I don't have $85 to give you, so what now?\" He finally got the picture and stated, \"I will just call my dispatcher and discuss it with him and we'll go from there. I said, \"thanks (name omitted)\", gave him a moment to leave my backyard, and locked the gate behind him.\n\nI don't have room to close this review.", "type": "review", "business_id": "x7LdJPrhOB2Iv_0PPIBB9g"}

She had no idea what kind of salad dressings they could offer.  She just kind of moped her way through our 45 minutes there.  The salads and a bowl of chili were served with the meal and not prior.  \nI ordered a hot sandwich.  When it was served, some of the meat was refrigerator cold.  Since the waitress was surprised, I touched the piece of meat I was referring to and she did the same.  I expected a replacement sandwich, but I can tell that all they did was put it in the microwave.  My room temperature bun was now very warm, my fries came back soggy and my pickle scalding hot.

Well, then you'll love Camden Copper Square apartments! In terms of ridiculous charges, they are the \"US Airways\" of apartments.\n\nOperated by the Wal-Mart of multi-family housing in America (Camden), the prosaic garden apartments near the Phoenix Children's Museum offer you the privilege of paying a broad array of fees. How about $30/month (plus $10/month for the trash dumpster) to have your trash picked up S-R nights outside your door? I guess they're going for true \"NY chic\" by allowing you to pay for the privilege of piling trash outside of your door in a wooden box. Don't worry! There's more. $40/month for \"included\" cable sound \"entertaining\"? Or expensive water fees that are charged based on square footage instead of how much water you use? I save the best for last, however. Enjoy paying $30/month for so-called \"association fees.\" This means the Camden corporation passes its property tax assessment for getting advertising in the city's downtown partnership \"Copper Square\" maps and pamphlets on to its residents. Stressed out about having to choose between \"valet trash\" or being a member of the \"association\"? Don't worry! You are required to pay both fees!\n\nWhile the office staff is generally friendly (some members are really exceptional) and maintenance service is adequate, the fees charged by this complex are entirely out of line when added to the complex's higher-than-average base rents. Attempts to reason with the regional staff about the fees are met by: \"this is a corporate-level/national policy.\"\n\nThe pool areas and club house are nice, but why pay so much for what you can get in any complex or condo community in Phoenix? The reason I still live here is because I'm leaving the area in May and wanted to spend the summer traveling and not moving boxes in the PHX oven. Those seeking a long-term home in downtown with more freedom of action than myself should pass over this fee-crazy complex for lower-priced condos or historic home rentals with more charm and nicer interior finishes. I'm just waiting for an announcement for a \"Camden Copper Square\" credit card to come out of my bedroom's fire alarm speaker and wake me up--yes, that would truly make this community rival this town's hometown airline for ridiculousness.", "type": "review", "business_id": "azUslwP4aD4EwN8J3QdnLQ"}

It also came highly recommended by my Dad, and knowing how picky he is, I knew I had to check this place out. \n\nAppetizers/Small Plates:\n\nBacon-Wrapped Scallops- I saw this as one of the review highlights and knew I had to have it. The BWS were huge, cooked perfectly and they are served with four amazing sauces that are the Chef's choice for the night. On this night they were 2 kinds of Green Salsa, Red Salsa and a Hollandaise sauce. My clear favorites were the Hollandaise and the Red Salsa but they were all good. 5*\n\nPan-Seared Salmon- Small bite-sized pieces of Salmon with a Chipotle-Mayo. The Salmon itself could've used some seasoning but the Chipotle-Mayo was excellent. 4*\n\nSanta Fe Trail:\n\nCarne Adovada- Smoked Pork shoulder that's simmered in a Red Chile sauce and served with Rice and Beans. The Rice and Beans were pretty standard, but the Pork itself was excellent. It literally seemed to get better and better as the meal went on but it also got progressively hotter and hotter as the meal went on; I was sweating like Britney Spears on Jeopardy by the time I was done eating. 4.5*\n\nChile Potato- Apparently this is one of the dishes that Rokerij is famous for. It's a fire-roasted green Hatch Chile that's stuffed with a mashed potato mixture. I'm not sure if I had it on an off-night, or what, but it just didn't do it for me. I mean everything was there for a stupendous dish but there just wasn't any flavor. I had my sis and Bro-in-law try some just to verify it wasn't me and they agreed it was a fail. 2*\n\nBeverages- Rokerij has a really impressive wine selection -which I'm not really into- and a mediocre beer selection; I was not impressed with their draft selection. They also have an \u00fcber-cool underground (literally and figuratively!) bar that is separate from the restaurant itself; I can imagine the shenanigans that ensue there! 4*\n\nService & Ambiance- Our waitress was very friendly and extremely knowledgeable about the menu because my sister always has questions (Oy gevalt...) and she answered them all quickly and to her satisfaction. Rokerij is very dark; has a nice wood and brick interior; and even has a fireplace going at all times--which is kinda odd seeing that it's in Arizona. The ambiance is definitely set for a date night kinda mood: very romantic and sexy--not the place you wanna bring a precocious 3-year-old (Whoops!). 4.75*\n\nValue- Pretty good value for a really nice place like this. I'd say the avg entr\u00e9e runs anywhere from $15-30; which is pretty good for high quality food. 4*\n\nIf you're looking for a great restaurant to impress a special someone; a place to celebrate a special event; or even something as casual as a date night then this is the place for you. I wouldn't recommend bringing kids with you as it's just not a kid friendly place and that's ok, too. You don't have to take the little monsters everywhere.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5kRug3bEienrpovtPRVVwg"}

This last stay over the weekend will probably be my last time I visit. There was no place suitable to eat in the hotel after 11 p.m.\nThe only thing open was McDonald's. Nobody eats McDonald's. \nHousekeePing skipped us one of our three days and by the time we got back into the room late night it was too late to call for someone so we just let it go. \n\nWe paid a daily resort fee for amenities. But yet we were charged additional fees to use the treadmills. So ridiculous. Total cheapskates. That is outrageously offensive.\n\nOn our last night on Sunday valet wait was over 30 minutes and that was in 107 degree heat. \nTheir nightclub Hakkasan should be shut down by the Health Department and fire department immediately. It is a cancer on the mgm brand.\n\nThere is no longer anything grand about this property. They run a bare-bones staff and the staff that are there are no longer engaged in customer service.  \n\nWe hit the buffet a couple of times but it was overpriced for what you get. They had three aisles of food and every aisle had  identical items. Powdered eggs and bacon in pools of grease. \n\nTypically in most casinos you can float through the gaming area and hear screams of joy with multiple jackpots being won at different slot machines. Over the 4 days and 3 nights that we were there we never saw one person hit anything big. Not once. \n\nIt is unfortunate that this hotel is nothing more than a oversized Holiday Inn with a Best Western mentality of service.

I booked directly from mlife for a king nonsmoking room.\n\nWe ended up not getting the room type and the front desk told us they would put in a room change request for us and we could be moved (upgraded) the next day. \n\nBy the next day when we called the front desk, they told us there was no room change request and no notes on our record about that at all. They also said the hotel is totally booked and no upgrade would be available.  I have to say we were pretty disappointed in the communication break down. We did eventually get moved when we walked up to the front desk in person again later on in the afternoon. We didn't get the upgrade we were promised (which we didn't mind, consider it was just a kind gesture anyway), but it was still an upgrade to a higher level room and finally in the room type we reserved. \n\nOther than that we were very happy with our stay. I always sleep very well at Bellagio. The rooms are very quiet (and I'm a light sleeper who travels with ear plugs) and the bed/linens are so comfortable. I would say the decor isn't my personal taste but it fits the theme. \n\nThe pool area is spacious, and there are many different dining options. We grabbed a quick breakfast at the patisserie, and enjoyed their buffet (which is a separate review) more than the buffet at Caesar's, or cosmopolitan's. \n\nLocation wise it's extremely convenient as well. It has a tram that can save you some walking/taxi. And it's pretty central on the strip. We easily walked to Venetian on one side and MGM on the other. \n\nThe O show is amazing as well and we received a discount on the tickets for being a hotel guest. You need to get your tickets early if you want good seats as they do sell out fairly quickly.\n\nEven though it's not as new as some of the new comers on the strip, the hotel has maintained itself very well. The air is always clean smelling when you walk into the lobby, and other than some of the decor and lower ceilings you really can't tell how old this place is.\n\nFor me this is one of the top picks to stay for convenience and quality of stay. I don't think the rooms are the most luxurious and/or spacious from some of its' competitors like Wynn or Venetian so if that's what you're looking for you might be slightly disappointed.  Also I think the atmosphere here is more mature. There's no crazy night/day clubs so you don't get the party crowd here either, which was fine for us but if you're looking for a hotel for your bachelor party trip then this is probably not it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-7yF42k0CcJhtPw51oaOqQ"}

Yep. You read that correctly. \n\nOthers of note are the Thai Ketchup and Chipotle Mayo.

Dr Halterman was the best, most informed, and kindest vet I've ever seen. They spent a lot of time with us talking about all the symptoms, possible causes and the treatment options and told us the pros and cons of each treatment and test. We didn't feel rushed at all, and we felt that they empathized with us as owners of a sick pet. When we had to leave our kitty overnight, they let us go back and say goodnight to her first. They were about 50% more expensive than a regular vet, but that's to be expected for an emergency vet. Wait times were fast for us.", "type": "review", "business_id": "60uPTxKX-AYCDRodPex3cA"}

A. Bank in Middleton, I would give them a 5-star rating; unfortunately, though, a previous less-than-stellar customer service experience I had there has left a lingering bad taste in my mouth, so a cumulative 4 stars it is. That being said:\n\nWithout exception: When you go to this location, work with JON VINJE. He is kind, patient, and, most important, knows dress clothes and how they should fit.\n\nMost recently, I went in looking for a traditional navy blue suit to wear at my new job in the financial sector, and he quickly pulled two beautiful suits for me to try. Without wasting my time while he looked through all of the options hanging in the store, he went immediately to the two he knew would fit me best, and he was right: both of the suits he pulled fit my body well, even though they were different cuts. I ended up buying the first suit he pulled for me, and, other than some minor alterations I'll have to get done, the suit fits me perfectly right out of the store.\n\nI had such a great experience working with Jon on my navy suit that I decided to look at buying an additional suit and some dress shirts while in the store. We discussed some color options that would expand my current collection, and then he pulled one suit -- just one -- and I ended up buying it because it's perfect. Same thing on the shirts: he pulled one style, I tried it on, it was perfect, so I got two in that style.\n\nBecause I'm moving, I'll be getting the suits fitted by a local tailor in my new location, so can't give feedback on how well this Jos. A. Banks does with alterations.\n\nThanks for a great experience, Jon!\n\nMore general feedback about the store:\n+ They have lots of great sales throughout the year, so there's no reason, really, to ever buy full price.\n+ They have a good selection of styles and colors in all of their products: shirts, pants, suits, coats, sweaters, etc.\n+ Convenient location in Greenway Station\n The fitting rooms are pretty small, and there's only one mirror shared between the 3, so you'll have to share the mirror with someone(s) else if other people are also trying on clothes.\n Be forewarned that, if you go during the \"Buy One Get ___ Free\" sale, you may have trouble finding anything other than black or grey suits in popular sizes.", "type": "review", "business_id": "iKSRDvLeTM3Apj0cvT3Xbw"}

The ambiance was minimalist and no frills -- but I didn't pay much attention. \n\nI ordered the Roasted Vegetable Sandwich that is served on a fresh roll.  It was loaded with vegetables and dripping with mozzarella. It was a fantastic sandwich and had great flavors.  It came with soup or salad -- I opted for the Minestrone.  It was good -- not outstanding, but good.  It also included bread (two types!) and butter. \n\nLa Cucina Flegrea has two great things going for it:\n\n1.

I asked the dentist how I could require that much work when I regularly went to another dentist for over 10 years ( last visit was 6-months prior to going to Western Dental) and he never detected any of the problems that they found.  The dentist shrugged her shoulders and said I don't know.  Then they sent in the \"business manager\" to discuss financing options.  As I continued to wait, I overheard other patients getting similar news to their dismay.\n\nI allowed them to give me a cleaning - another mistake!  And, I had them fill a filling - another mistake.  Finally, I had them put on a crown - which I knew needed to be replaced.\n\nAs soon as I was able to find a new dentist, I bailed on Western Dental.

It meant that you'd live at the MVD for an entire day without food, water, facilities, and would be swamped with boredom and suicidal thoughts.\n\nToday the MVD is much easier to palette. To start off, if you go online you can see the amount of people in line as well as the estimated wait time. You can do this for the MVD office as well as emissions testing (they even have cameras at the emissions testing place). In my experience, the times are fairly accurate.\n\nWhen I arrived I noted the time the website said. Website says 11mins, 16 people in line at 8:57am. I was called to my first window (to retake my licence photo) at 9:05am. I was called to my final window at 9:12am. I was out of the parking lot before 9:30am. \n\nWebsite estimated time: 11mins\nTime to final window: 15mins.\nPretty damn good!\n\nAs for the people complaining about the \"randomness\" of the number calling. If you actually observed you'd understand that all the numbers are called in order, i.e. A-001, A-002, A-003, etc. while at the same time other prefixes may be on different numbers... T-041... So you might hear D-123, A-009, T-014, etc but that doesn't mean that they are going out of order... it simply means that different jobs categories are being processed. I had an \"A\" which I assume is for general tasks such as renewing licences. Other letters probably mean vehicle inspections, legal, licence testing, etc.\n\nAlso, something else that is nice is that you can do the paperwork at home and print off a \"barcode\" and take it there and just give it to the clerk so they don't have to type anything in. They just scan and then do the other tasks that are actually needed aside from typing.\n\nSo here is my suggestions:\n(1) Leave your attitude at home. You're dealing with the red-tape queen - the government. Everyone is in this together, including the workers.\n(2) Don't expect to be in and out on your lunch break. This isn't Jimmy Johns serving you a sub.\n(3) Come with your cell phone charged up to read the news or watch YouTube or a good-old fashioned book.\n(4) Do as much paperwork at home and bring in the printout.\n(5) Check the website to see the wait time. Sometimes if you drive a little further than your normal office you can save a lot of time.", "type": "review", "business_id": "IIbdmP2RwBwttQf36cf44Q"}

Completely non-smoking.  This is a must for me; casinos, even when on a non-smoking floor, usually lead to asthma and allergy problems for me, so I love how non-smoky this place is.  In fact, if you're not aware, all Marriotts have gone completely non-smoking and I am thrilled about this.\n\n2.) My pup can stay here with me. \n\n3.) There is a full kitchen.  On my way into town, I stop at the awesome Whole Foods and stock the fridge and never feel like I have to eat every meal out.\n\n4.) It is always clean, and the rooms are very spacious.  Even the \"One bedrooms\" have a pull out couch, so you could technically sleep 4 people there.  There is also room for an aerobed if necessary.  Tons of space.\n\n5.) Easy check in, easy parking easy EVERYTHING.   The staff here is awesome, efficient, always helpful.  It is far enough away from the strip to be quiet, but close enough to go wherever you need to go\n\n6.) Free breakfast.  Its not gourmet, but there are at least eggs, several different types of breads and cereals, oatmeal, etc.  Its pretty cool.\n\n7.) Free shuttle to and from Mandalay Bay and MGM until about 1am, also shuttle to and from the airport. \n\nThe prices are also always really good, though they have increased slightly lately, probably because the word is out.

I'll point out that the culinary competition is rather low in the overstreet mall considering the only three restaurants next to Maddio's are Chick Fil A, Salsarita's and Just Fresh (all equally mediocre). \"How Do You Roll\" lasted a couple of months here, but its presence dissipated in a matter of days once people realized their \"sushi\" was 98% rice and ridiculously overpriced. On the other hand, Maddio's deserves to be in a class of its own because Fast Casual restaurants are hard to find around here (you pretty much just have Noodles & Co., Chipotle, Jason's Deli and Vappiano's... and that's like all Charlotte has to offer in this segment).\n \nMaddio's showcased item is of course, its pizza and I'll admit that I was pleasantly surprised. I'm a huge fan of thin crust pizza, and having just come back from Milan, I'm always searching (perhaps in vain) for that same delicious and savory crunch I experienced there. Nevertheless, my favorite part of a pizza is its tomato sauce and I really liked the version they have here. You can smell fresh garlic and perhaps some basil? It's also not too watery or dry. There are other sauces I have yet to try... I was eyeing the \"tomato bbq\". As far as pizza crusts go, this one is certainly acceptable. It's very crisp and holds its shape when you pick up a slice. I do like this pizza much better than Vappiano's which a bit more doughy and its tomato sauce tends to be over salted.\n \nDisclaimer: You can't expect pizza at a fast casual joint like this to be as good as a wood-fired pizza from your favorite Italian restaurant because, let's be real, you wouldn't be able to churn something like that out with the same efficiency that they have here. I only waited 5-6 minutes for my pizza to arrive steaming hot to my table (I tried the spicy Italian on traditional crust - you could also go for the wheat option). For what it is (a  $7 - $8 individual pizza), you'll find yourself eating every last slice. Toppings are varied and fairly good quality - you can even create your own pizza. I like that you can see your pizza being made through the glass window, so you know exactly what you're about to eat.\n \nThe salad we ordered paled in comparison to the pizza and some of the sandwich options I saw at people's tables, but that could just be because they stuck to a simple salad menu with generic dressings that every other restaurant has. I think I'll just stick to pizzas when I come here.\n \nThere are lots of options for everyone and if you have that \"I've tried one pizza, I've tried them all\" mentality, Uncle Maddio's just might make you rethink that philosophy.\n \n4/5", "type": "review", "business_id": "AlxZVcq_DOobj6RwTejrXg"}

One would expect a meal at Vieux-Port to be very pricey, but believe me, the whole dining experience here will worth every penny.\n\nReservations can be made online, which was definitely convenient. Upon entering the restaurant, we were immediately greeted and seated. The ambience in the evening was incredible: live jazz available at late night, retro style decor of the 80's, dim lighting and of course, the inevitable clich\u00e9 of a romantic dinner---candlelight.\n\nWe went during Happening Gourmand 2014, and thus I cannot comment on the regular pricing of the dishes, since we had the special three-course menu. What I can say is that the food and the service were perfect.\n\nThe service was extremely caring, fast, and efficient. The waiter was very courteous throughout the night, and came regularly to ask if the food was cooked to our likings and to fill my glass. There was only two waiters in the whole establishment, but the service was always up to standard.\n\nThe Fried Calamari was very scrumptious, the batter were impeccably seasoned and fried to perfection. The calamari was very fresh, with a crispy and yet not very greasy outer shell. The homemade mayo sauce made it even better. Comparing to the seafood, the other appetizer kind of shy away from the spotlight. The Duck Rillettes was well prepared, quite exquisite, but nothing too spectacular.\n\nThe Lamb Chops with Oregano was absolutely fantastic, it was flawlessly seasoned and cooked to a beautiful, splendid medium-rare. The oregano wisely masked the lamb's gamey taste, while complementing other elements of the dish. The Trout Amandine was somewhat average, the fish was beautifully cooked but lacked seasoning. In my opinion, the risotto that came with the trout was actually better than the fish itself, as it was very flavourful with a beautiful texture.\n\nThe Tiramisu was succulent, divine, heavenly, perhaps godlike. It was not too sweet,  and the texture was smooth and silky, a plate of pleasure to eat.\n\nI shall comeback soon, hungry for more.", "type": "review", "business_id": "RULtOFDb3HBo7a5HAQ8sWQ"}

I started with Octopus which was delicious followed by the lobster pici. The pici was very nice indeed, tasty and pretty rich. The pasta itself was very dense and cooked al dente which took a little more effort to eat than perhaps it should have. It was a good size portion. I had a cheesecake for desert but at that point was too full to really appreciate it's intricate flavors. My wife started with the lobster salad which was also excellent followed by the Branzino, again delicious. Modern d\u00e9cor with a chilled yet sophisticated ambience. I wore a jacket but pretty sure you could dine here in a t-shirt if you wanted to. We dropped just over $300 for the evening including a modestly priced bottle of white wine.

Some of the same group were there for this Sunday April 8th 2012 dinner. We were a large group, and the restaurant claimed it was \"no problem\". I'm sure we were all aware that we were going to be hit with an automatic 'large group' gratuity fee, and we were totally willing and able to pay it. While ordering, I inquired of our server (T#m) if it was possible to get \"separate bills\". He said that it would \"all be divided at the end\". OK. So we order. Some people's meals were much more expensive than others. The food was stellar. End of the meal, and the bill comes. One big bill. For everybody. When T#m was asked why our bills were not separated we were told: \"We don't do that here\". Which is BS, as I'd had it done before. We proceeded to spend about ONE HOUR trying to figure out who was supposed to pay for what. It COMPLETELY KILLED the good meal we had just consumed. In retrospect I believe he was just worried that we were trying to snake our way out of paying the automatic 'large group' gratuity. I normally over-tip as it is, but on this occasion I think I was sure to pay not a penny over what was required - purely out of spite. Oh yeah, he also uttered this gem: \"This isn't Denny's\". Huh, well Denny's has it all over the Golden Steer, as they automatically separate your bills! I don't think the Maitre D' was too impressed with T#m either, as he was openly mocking him whilst serving the appetizers. \n It was doubly embarrassing for me personally as I had a couple of first-timers with me along for the experience. They were APPALLED at what occurred. Not a good experience, and a pricey one too!\n I'd consider going again if I knew that T#m didn't work there anymore.", "type": "review", "business_id": "YZuHOgbKiP3dN4_ROOUyDQ"}

My expectations were low, but not this low, this place is just weird. Read on...\n\nFirst I go to the counter to see about getting a room and they tell me to go online. Why would someone go online if they are looking at you from across they Check In Counter???... \"But I'm standing right in front of you\" I said. They said it's cheaper to book online. I said, \"so I need to stand her in front of you and do this on my cell phone!?\" Yes, she replied. So, after 15 minutes of creating logins and passwords the damned system froze and would not book it, so I said forget it. Just book it for me please. The person looked befuddled and finally got me a room.\n\nWe got a twin room that is supposed to have two twin beds.... and the beds are NOT twin size, they are smaller than twins by at least 8-10 inches, no, I'm not kidding. The beds are the same size as my outdoor camping cot. Really, what is the point of these super tiny beds? Are they afraid that people may double up on the twins or did it really save that much money? The rooms were big enough for a normal twin beds, my God, maybe this was a dog bed, I don't know.\n\nSo I go to shower and they only had 1 towel in the room, no hand towel, no facecloth or bath mat. Wouldn't the genius who runs this place at least think that if two people were staying in a room with two tiny beds, probably would not want to share 1 towel?!\n\nThe paint and decorations are horrible, it reminded me of a low budget airline. It looks like something you would imagine in a mental institution.\n\nSo, I then figure that I will go online with my phone to try to wash the fact that I am staying in this place out of my mind and find out they charged for WIFI. OMG, even the bars around here have free WIFI.  At this point I'm looking around the room for a hidden camera to see if I am on some Comedy TV Show. But no, this was someone's actual business plan.

My favorite is the Sweet and Pungent Chicken or Shrimp.  The coating is perfectly crispy and the sauce glazes each piece perfectly.  Think Orange Chicken with a little kick.  Other items that are great are the Chow Mein with it's slight smokiness, Tom Yum Soup with Noodles has a nicely flavored broth and they will spice it however you like.  Also comes with a separate container full of noodles for take away.  Finally,  my son loves the Yellow Panang Curry.  Great veggie selection and plenty of whatever protein you choose to put in it.

Don't feel sorry for him as he has eaten more than his fair share of my leftovers while I toil away at work!\n\nDo yourself a favor and go to Tott's for the best asian food in the valley that falls into the category somewhere between Americanized Asian food and \"real\" Asian cuisine.

Yelpers raving about it, the place has all these awards, magazines are talking about it, there's an iron chef challenger/winner here, etc etc. With all the hype, I was a bit cautious, but still expecting to get my socks completely blown off. Was it a disappointment? I wouldn't go that far, the place is good. Service is awesome, food is high quality. But, it just isn't as great as what people will want you to think. \n\nLike most of my foodie adventures with friends, we all had a cocktail. They were all good, and we sampled a large selection. I don't think anything from this bar would disappoint. \n\nFor food, we started with the crispy white beans. Very different, and that's why we got them. I still don't have a solid opinion on them, but they're strangely addicting. Salty, oily, cheesy, thyme-y. Give 'em a try, at least you can say you did. We also had the onion straws with Tarbell's \"Secret Sauce.\" These are good, I'd recommend them for a group appetizer, but just nothing that spectacular.\n\nFor the entree, obviously I had to try the scotch beef. This was pretty good. The gravy was amazing. The beef itself, though, is just a roast. I've had the same thing a thousand times at home. My mom could rival Mr. Tarbell's famous scotch beef anyday with a slow cooked roast, and she's no iron chef. Still, it was good and I would get it again. Tender, juicy, flavorful. The potatoes it sat on were good, too, but really the special part is the gravy.\n\nOthers at the table had salmon and the house ribbon pasta. Salmon was good, nothing out of this world. The pasta was also not super impressive, just nice, good quality food.\n\nWe couldn't resist dessert and got the chocolate cake with pistachio ice cream. This was truly awesome. Creme brulee was also really quite good. \n\nThis review wouldn't be complete without mentioning the service and the atmosphere. This place really does a good job taking care of people. The server we had was amazing and all of the staff was super attentive. They know the menu, give good suggestions, and truly make you feel like a guest. This goes a long way nowadays in restaurants and in my opinion this alone gives them an extra star.\n\nSpeaking of stars, this place is really good. In no way does it deserve a 5-star review. 4 stars, sure, but they aren't getting it on food alone.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zG_wv69bsllw_PWhOmoAKQ"}

On June 29th, we accepted the contract, and agreed to a flexible schedule, which meant dropping the price about a thousand dollars in exchange for pushing the schedule out.\n\nSeptember 18th is when they came out and did the work - 2 and a half months after signing the contract. A long time to wait, but only a little bit longer than the 8-10 weeks their flexibility discount disclosed. The work took less than a day.\n\nLater that evening, I had a close look at some of the work, and found it to be unsatisfactory. The majority of the stamped concrete was ok, with a few exceptions - some chips that were kind of expected with new concrete, and a couple rough patches. The grass seems to be good. However, the planters are absolutely awful. There were lots of cracks, a lousy paint job, a corner that was nowhere near straight, splashed paint everywhere, and it just looked terrible everywhere.\n\nI wanted to give them a fair chance to make it right - if they could fix it, I'd still be happy with the work.\n\nI contacted them that night, and followed up with pictures the next morning. I was told someone would be out in a couple weeks. On 10/5, I followed up, and they were \"behind schedule\", in their queue for the end of October. On 10/26, I followed up again, and was told they were still somehow way behind due to all the rain this year - there was rain, but I don't see how a few days of rain can put you a month behind schedule for taking care of your paying customers.\n\nOn 11/18, I gave them one more chance, clearly stating that I needed someone out there now in order to give them the opportunity to make me a satisfied customer. They called and gave me a scheduled date in mid-January (about 4 months after I first reported their problems). I told them it was absolutely unacceptable, and asked them to inform their general manager of my disapproval. They responded and gave me a date of December 14th, which is 3 weeks from today, and apparently that's the best they can do. Nearly three months (and five and a half months from contract date), that's just not good enough.\n\nBased on my experience, this company does not seem to care about their customers' schedules and they seem to have no concern for customer satisfaction. Regardless of whether or not they clean up their issues when they finally come out, I would not recommend this company.\n\nBTW, all the photos I've attached here were taken the day after the job was completed, and I sent all of them to Sharp, showing them exactly why I was dissatisfied.", "type": "review", "business_id": "g6r8T0nvxlrpJB-khmqntw"}

In addition to having one of the nicer, cleaner, facilities, Ivy Laser was the best price I found. The owner, Ani, tried to put me at ease during the treatment and explained everything. She was also easy when it came to scheduling appointments that fit my schedule. As an added bonus, it is also nice to support local and women owned businesses. I would say that some areas are pain free to treat, but areas such as my lower legs were very sensitive.  After a treatment, it takes a week for the hair to actually come out. But, without the hair growing, my skin is actually a lot smoother. I also love how much time I save now that I don't have to shave every day.

Then after waiting in line for a long time while 3 clerks that weren't helping anyone sat around visiting we were finally waited on. I was charged. $150 deposit that would not be refunded until 5 days after my return date, even though I paid with a credit card. I have never heard of such a thing. The clerk told me that it was because they were so cheap. When she was done with my paperwork, she instructed me to go outside and wait in another line to hey my car. Another LONG line. As we waited, I heard the outside attendant tell a customer that had rented an economy car that they were all out of economy cars so they could have the last full size car. When she came to me she tried to get me to take a 2 door hard top Mustang, which is much smaller inside than the car I reserved. I refused so she told me that I would have to wait on hour or two for the next full size car. I pointed out that I had RESERVED a full size car and asked for a refund.

For dinner we ordered the Insalata Milanese, breaded veal over greens with delicious mozzarella and  chiffonade tomatoes was simple and satisfying, I would come back for this salad alone!

The fries, sweet potato and regular, are crisp, salty and delicious.  They are served in miniature shopping carts with the D for Delux emblazoned on the front.

However, the aioli which is spicy but still smooth makes up for the lack of 1000 as a substitute condiment.   \n\nThe beer list is extensive and the menus are adorable.

We came here on a weekday morning just after 9am and were seated promptly with a smile, a few rows away from the small pool outside (the hostess joked that it was the Venetian's \"kiddie pool\").  The restaurant is smaller than I thought it would be, with very high ceilings and an airy, sunlit atmosphere.  \n\nI had the Breakfast Jardiniere with eggs over medium, choosing a chocolate croissant.  It was obvious that the chefs really pay attention to the details.  The croissant came first with a cup of fruit.  Flaky and amazingly buttery, the croissant had delicious bittersweet chunks of chocolate.  Each cube of fruit, whether grape or cantaloupe, was sweet and ripe.\n  The eggs came with a toasted brioche, sauteed spinach, and a side of potatoes cut to the size of nickels.  The eggs were an incredibly deep yellow color (from naturally-raised chickens, perhaps?) that I haven't seen from eggs in ages.  The light oil and salt on the potatoes made for a tiny dance of flavor in my mouth.  The sauteed spinach came with big chunks of garlic.  I'm a real garlic lover, so I actually wanted an even stronger garlic taste from the spinach, but I couldn't complain about the tender texture.\n\nI also tried the Oeuf Au Gratin, a deep dish of baked eggs that was a spoonful of richness.  Their coffee was excellent, and their orange juice was very good as well.\n\nI'm recommending this breakfast to all my friends that are headed to Vegas.

I normally call in to do pickup orders, so when I come in the \"pick up side\" there is usually no one at the counter.  I think there is a door buzzer, but it's next to the door, not in the kitchen where everybody apparently is, so when I come in I usually just stand there until someone happens to wander up front.  What's worse is sometimes there a waitress walking back and forth from the dining room and she of course can see me at the counter because we make eye contact, but again, nothing.  I don't even think she mentioned I was out there. On another occasion I ordered a SMALL deep dish pizza and when I came to pick it up the girl at the counter pulled out a large pizza box.  I said \"I ordered a small\" she said \"this is how they come, the order is right.  Like a dummy I believed her because I didn't want to be rude and open it in front of her, not to mention if it was right she would probably have another remark for me.  So of course I got home and it was totally wrong, a large thin crust pizza. However the manager did call me back to warn me I left my pizza there. I left my pizza there?  You gave me the wrong one!  I hate checking the food before I leave.  I'm not sure why that is put on me, they should be getting the order correct.\n\nNext is just a small complaint, but they advertise the Chicago Bears (being a Chicago based food establishment), they even hand out Bears refrigerator magnets with all the dates of the Bears games.  There was even a sign that advertised \"come watch the Bears games here\".  However when I came one Sunday, the girl in the dining room said \"we only get the televised games\".  What a disappointment. So I just went to a sports bar down the street that had the game televised. If you are going to broadcast the Chicago Bears and their games, maybe invest in a Sunday Ticket with Direct TV so the Bears fans have a place to go.\n\nConsistency.  Not too big of a deal, but every-time I order the Italian Beef Sandwich, its random if I will get hot gardenia, on the sandwich or on the side. Or if I will get Aj Jus at all. Also it doesn't feel like the staff is well versed on Chicago foods like Italian beef, when I asked for it \"dipped\" I sometimes have to explain that is when you dipped the entire sandwich in the Aj Jus. This also worries me that they might not have the right utensils to properly \"dip\" a sandwich. Which leads me to the 3rd issue:\n\nCleanliness... There's no excuse for this, and I've had some pretty gross issues.  Again, back to the Italian Beef. I brought the food home and started eating the sandwich about halfway through I end up pulling a 12 inch piece of hair out of my mouth. Probably the grossest thing to ever happened to me food wise. That is until the NEXT weekend I thought I would give it another chance. Again I brought the food home and halfway through the sandwich I pull a strand of stainless steel wool cleaning pad from my mouth! Now we are not talking just gross human hair, but potentially dangerous foreign OBJECTS in the food. It's almost like the Aj Jus sauce bin is used as a trash can.  I have yet to try the beef sandwich again. The thought of what is going on back there to allow steel wool and human hair in beef broth is beyond gross.  My assumption is the staff doesn't care (which I mentioned before).  The must be no pride taken with cleanliness. \n\nHere is the actual sad part, the food is excellent tasting! Well, that is before the mental stigma of gross objects being in the food happens. It bothers me because the is the closest thing to \"Chicago food\" within a few miles of my house.  I'm not saying this to be mean to Rosati's, I really want them to address these issues so I can come back. I just think they need to get the staff involved or get a staff that cares. Other than that this place has a lot of potential.", "type": "review", "business_id": "994TtJYxB68eSscnCr94qQ"}

When I shop I have a much clearer focus on what to buy that will be flattering for my shape and targeted style (work or fun). She had other great tips and tricks on how to make shoes not kill your feet and some tailoring suggestions for a jacket that didn't quite fit right.

Other than the whole table issue everything else was pretty much okay the atmosphere was really nice the food was okay not the best I've ever had but it was good.  I think this place is more interested in catering to larger parties  then a small bill for two people which is understandable that they going to make more money on a larger party then they are two people I get it but still we are paying customers so we should be just as important.

At the rental gear area the first staff member we encountered did not once smile at us, and in general seemed to wish he was anywhere but at work. When asking for suggestions on where to camp and hike (being the national parks were closed) he did not have anything to offer, but did steer us towards a staff member that did help. This staff member was very nice, and did seem generally happy to be at work and to be talking to us. After chatting with him for a few minutes we went to the check out line to purchase a couple items. Again our cashier was extremely unfriendly! Did not once make eye contact, never smiled, and shoved our items into the bag to rush us out the door. We just could not believe our experience. Rei is a great company and every employee should be happy to work there! I could not believe these two employees were representative of this wonderful company; had we been first time visitors we would not have come back.

Now, we are in a suite with surround sound but ok, we took what they said and turned the music completely off. About 40 minutes later they came back saying they were going to evict us from out room because they can hear people talking and the pool table. At this point we asked to speak to the hotel manager because we were more than transparent about the intended use of the room, and this is a group of business professionals not rowdy teenagers. The experience of our apex suite definitely reached its apex when assistant hotel manager Brian came up. You could tell he was completely under qualified and/or green in his position because his customer service was the worst I have ever seen. He said he he gave us the third warning and that was all like he was going to do. I spoke with him in a completely professional manner, I live and work in this town. I am a customer service general manager on the Las Vegas strip. I told him I value that he values the stay of all of his guests whether they paid $69 for a guest room or $800 for a suite. But that it is 930 pm and we have done everything they have asked. It is unreasonable for them to ask that we not speak or use amenities that are provided to make this room what it is. I even offered as frustrated and as inconvenienced as it would be that our entire party would be willing to move to another room or even another Ceasar's entertainment property. I asked what his occupancy of the hotel was and what he could do to rectify the situation of that we are just as inconvenienced and upset as whomever is complaining I assure you. He kept incessantly rolling his eyes, shaking his head and walking away and back up to the conversation. He told us that his hands were tied on moving us and and doing ANYTHING for us customer service wise because we had booked though a third party. We told him we did not book through a third party we booked through the number from the Planet Hollywood Web site and Planet Hollywood was on the statement of the charge. He said to contact them and walked away. The security guards that were left standing there kept continually apologizing. Saying they hadn't seen anything like this, they are being made to do this and if they were us they would be extremely pissed. They don't think we are being overly loud and everything we have asked has been more than reasonable. So we went back into the room and did what he said, called the number we booked from which rang to Planet Hollywood and Ceasar's entertainment. The man on the phone said that we had indeed booked through Planet Hollywood and he was so sorry he was going to get in touch with the manager to get this resolved. I waited on hold for 20 minutes. He came back on the phone and said he had no idea how to say this and that it'd going to sound rude but that it wasn't coming from him, but that the front desk manager (our friend Brian) refuses to speak to us or about our situation, goodnight. He then kept apologizing saying he had no idea what to do. He would have been more than happy to help us but he can't without front desk approval. We called Ceasar's Palace to see of they could help us and they were so nice and felt awful but they needed it to come from Planet Hollywood's front desk as well so they couldn't do anything. The nice woman on the phone said she would go down to the front desk where we could be seen and make them speak to us there. So we took her advice, went down to the front desk where we met David, the new manager on duty. He told us again that he was not going to help us, that we booked through a third party and Brian's notes say nothing further will be done for us. But that the room is still ours the two people that checked in can stay. I kept telling him that we DID NOT BOOK THROUGH A THIRD PARTY AND I'M SICK OF HEARING THIS. Not to mention that even if we had what does that matter. MY REVIEW IS TOO LARGE PLEASE SEE TRIP ADVISOR FOR THE REST. BASCIALLY WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER", "type": "review", "business_id": "uJYw4p59AKh8c8h5yWMdOw"}

I figured I would try again, order something different and see what happens. The first time I ordered fajitas, so needless to say, I was not expecting much from this experience either. I was prepared for rude/slow service, watery, heavily odd spiced flavored salsa, boxed tasting rice and canned beans accompanying whatever bland tasting, rubbery tortilla having main dish. \nHowever, what I experienced was a friendly, attentive staff. I was seated immediately, and within minutes fresh chips and slightly better salsa at my table. I ordered seafood chimichangas (have been back several times and between myself and family we have ordered all of the seafood and fajitas). All have been absolutely wonderful, even the accompanying rice and beans were good. Guacamole is very good as well. \nI spoke with a Manager by the name of Miguel. He confirmed he had in fact seen the negative reviews and has listened and tried to correct our complaints. In my honest opinion, he really did.\nIf like myself you tried this place around the time they opened, had an awful experience as I did, perhaps you may want to try them again.

One star just seems way too generous, in my opinion.\n\nThis review is for the Salon located at J.C.Penney.  From appointment to final cut, my experience was HORRIBLE.  I would have preferred hand my bulldog a pair of scissors and let her go to town on my head.\n\nFirst off, the girl that scheduled my appointment and my sister's appointment scheduled us for an hour and a half apart.  I didn't agree to that, but whatever, a woman was there on her day off and they asked her to clock in.  Unfortunately, she wouldn't stop remarking about how she generously clocked in.\n\nWe each brought photos in for how our hair should be cut.  Mine's not bad, but my sister hates her hair, the woman spent more time diagnosing her dry scalp than actually paying attention to my sister's reference material.\n\nI walked out of there with such an intense headache from the spots where my gal had burned my scalp with the blow dryer.  I was never trained as a cosmetologist or an aesthetician, but isn't it common knowledge that you don't hold a blow dryer in the same spot for an extended amount of time?!  After I told her about it, she apologized but then remarked that it was easier to just get the root dried first.\n\nDoes somebody have the number for Tabatha?  I'm done, apparently J.C.Penney salons are now the skill equivelent to Super Cuts with more money tacked on at the end.  Yeah, I'm angry that I could have paid $14.00 and gotten a crappy cut somewhere else.", "type": "review", "business_id": "mZRwwtXsQR1TCzwLVkdieA"}

Don't ever go here if you're in any hurry. \n\n\nI've been in here with my wife several times for pedicures. On previous trips it was a decent experience, other than waiting past appointment times and realizing they don't really have a system for serving people in any given order. Not being in a hurry definitely help. \n\nToday my wife called ahead for an appointment and got us two appointments for 230pm. We had an hour before we had to leave so this allowed just enough time to finish according to the staff.  Upon our arrival the place was full with just two open seats, but of course not enough employees to service that many customers.\n\nWe waited 25 minutes for my wife to be waited on, followed by me being skipped twice. When an employee finally came over and started the treatment it had been a 35 minute wait.  The employee began to trim my nails and in In the middle of one she stopped to clean another work station, this after we told the front desk person that we were in a hurry because they were behind and after being skipped. They half-heartedly apologized and I told them I had to just skip the whole thing as not to be late.  They still wanted to try and rush the process. \n\nThis seems like a place that stays busy, so they have no concern if they give out very bad service on occasion.", "type": "review", "business_id": "uKETWlO3yEB_-jhoRtPYjg"}

The key word here is \"like\". It all looked so nice (we are paying for the \"likeness\" of luxury too believe me) but the bones of the place are not so nice. We have had so many issues since we moved in just a few months ago. The first day we were allowed to move in (we hadn't even seen the apartment itself yet) there was a leak and I had to bring my key to the office because they had lost their copy. Then all the cabinet doors starting falling off because they used the wrong hardware (five of them fell off one at a time), the towel bars fell off, the toilet roll holders fell off, the toilet handle continues to break, the sink handles are falling off, the drains are slow and clog quickly, our \"new\" washing machine broke and it took two weeks to have fixed and it still only works half the time. The entire building constantly smells of marijuana from the local residents. The windows are also so incredibly thin that the traffic on Grove Parkway sounds like the ocean. I try to pretend it is so that I can sleep at night, sadly.  To add insult to injury, they ripped up more than half of the available free parking spots to build a soccer field and refuse to give the residents even one free spot and charge $15 per month for a spot. I have been carting my groceries from the south side of complex to the north side because there is no parking anywhere near my apartment by the time I get home from work. I am really disappointed because I moved from an apartment where i had very little problems for five years AND paid $100 less per month, only to come here and have the place falling apart every time I touch something. We are debating now if moving out will be a better value than staying here, paying close to $1000 per month and being dissatisfied. \nThe one silver lining here is that the office staff is friendly and kind. They are helpful and concerned. It isn't their fault that the building materials are of the worst quality and they do their best to show concern and care.

There were many autographed shirts. $45 seemed to be the going price for anything signed. Alice is a generous and ubiquitous presence in the valley, with plenty of his autographs floating around. I'd suggest you pick up a signed shirt for your aging Alice Cooper fans/relatives in the Midwest.

I've tried 3 times and all 3 times have been disappointing.\n\nTrip #1:  Had the lobster roll for lunch.   Great deal at $13, but it was bland.  No taste.\n\nTrip #2:  The waitress was a bit rude and the service was slow.  Granted they were busy for a Saturday, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.  The Pan Roast my wife ordered was ok, but nothing compared to the Pan Roast at the Oyster Bar at South Point.  My Bouillabaisse was bland and tasteless also.\n\nTrip #3:  One last try, went for the AYCE snow crab dinner.  The worst Service I ever received.  Troy, our waiter was very forgetful and I had to wait forever for the crab.  It was not the freshest and not worth the $70 bill (before tip).\n\nNeedless to say, I will never be returning to that restaurant to eat.  The Oyster Bar at South point is leaps and bounds above this place.  One bright note:  Val, the hostess is always gracious and very hard working.  I see her busing tables, running around in her heels to help everyone.  She is a shining star in a dismal place to eat.", "type": "review", "business_id": "nQeAnwwJmfoyH8k4kSfqaQ"}

Years ago when I was a tourist, I remember the dealer paying me 3 times for hands that I lost. I just sat there and stayed quiet.  \n\nNot to mention that they are generous on comps, and the rooms are old but very big an comfortable.   \n\nThe food at the 24 hour cafe is usually free, so I don't care if it didn't taste good.

While playing Triple Wild Cherry with my free slot play, I ended up winning $900. \n\nThe coolest thing is that they give you comp dollars while you are using your free slot play!

There is a HUGE and FREE and PAVED parking lot right across the way and plenty of bars to stop by before the show.\n\nThe staff is efficient and friendly and lines are usually short or non-existent. \n\nWhen you first walk in, the stage is right in front of you and slightly to the right. You'll probably notice the ornate chandeliers and disco balls on the ceiling, which is a corporate Fillmore thing--all of them have it.\n\nThere are bars in every corner of this place and have yet to really wait for a drink. I have never had a bad experience with the bartenders who seem to always be friendly.\n\nNow I must tell you, drinks are NOT cheap. Expect to pay around $11 for small mixed drinks, $9 for Coorslight/Budlight tall boys and $12 for large craft draft beers. They usually have a decent selection of local and non-local craft beers. They even had Saranac on draft last week ,which I rarely find in grocery markets!\n\nThe other issue I have is the bathroom location. They are on the opposite side of the entrance in the corner and when shows are sold out or even near sold out it is almost impossible to get to during the show. To make it worse, this is also where you go to get to the smoking deck (stage of the amphitheater) so during set breaks its like heard of slow moving cattle and takes forever to get anywhere.\n\nDespite an awkward bathroom location configuration, they are immaculate and plentiful. Some of the best bathroom facilities I have ever been in and I don't recall ever having to wait in line.\n\nThe stage is high off the ground and there are a few raised sections off the floor each with a banister to set drinks on. In short, there is not a bad spot in this place.\n\nThe acoustic and sound is always impeccable. Some of my favorite shows have been here and there seems to always be a good crowd. \n\nThe Fillmore brings in quite a wide variety of different genres and is a routine stop for some of my favorite artists during their national tours. I do wish they booked more jamband/bluegrass type acts and less punk/mental, but hey!

The grocery section is really what makes it \"super\" but the rest of the store is larger than your average Target. Some of the departments carried additional merchandise but it did seem like there was a lot of empty space. It's that time in the season where summer stuff starts to go on clearance to make room for the new items coming in so this could have contributed to that.\n\nThe grocery section is nice..not as abundant as your average supermarket of course, but they did have a decent selection. I normally wouldn't choose to buy produce and meat from a Target, but if I lived in the area I might consider buying from this one. There isn't an onsite butcher, all meat is prepacked (like a Trader Joe's) but there is an onsite Bakery and Prepared Foods area. Items were competitively priced, I didn't notice any great deals or anything that was overpriced. Einstein's Bagels has a self serve case in the bakery section, that that looked pretty sad. The other food aisles were well stocked and easy to shop.\n\nTarget, in general, is one of my favorite stores. As far as product, stores are consistent. At this location the prices are higher than my local store but that wouldn't stop me from coming here if I was in the area and needed to pick up some things.

Tried again a little earlier on the next Saturday and successfully set a reservation for 2pm. Got there a few minutes after, and to my surprise, the place was nearly empty considering the full list the weekend before. Our server was nice & cheerful. I ordered the bacon croissant sliders & my hunny ordered the green & white omelet, both of which came with breakfast potatoes. The food took a pretty long while to come out for the place to be so un-busy, but it was all delicious. Music selection was a cool eclectic mix...maybe a good Pandora channel? All-in-all great brunch in a modern chill spot without all the hustle & bustle. May try the patio next time.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5dSQ1KV9HkbZm0ZmJHuMKA"}

My lovable, well behaved dog was refused service by the company. During my consultation for a dog walker, I requested that my dog remain on his leash at all times outside of our home. I explained that our neighbor had put a complaint in to animal control for being off leash near our front yard. It was not a formal complaint or a fine. The representative that came to our door simply said not to worry about anything, but that because they had to follow up on every complaint, just to make sure to keep him on a leash at all times. I was told that due to liability reasons, they cannot give services to any dog that has had any association with animal control. I read through all of the company's fine print and it did not mention the words animal control at all. It did, however, say that they do not provide service to animals that they deem aggressive. I sincerely hope that the refusal of service has nothing to do with his breed. Unfortunately, my sweet pittie mix Rocky, has dealt with breed discrimination far too often. The company's owner left a message with the news and said that they would leave our key under our mat, however the paperwork did say the company would never leave or hide keys on our property. This is just a heads up to anyone who went through a situation like ours, so you hopefully will not go through the disappointment that our family did.", "type": "review", "business_id": "7QGZs89RhDkQ30g3fepJ1A"}

The buffet at Aria was average. It was unimpressive for what i thought would be a buffet equal to that of other 5-star hotels like Bellagio or Wynn. \n\nIn terms of variety, I felt the aria buffet tried to accomplish that by offering a number of different international cuisines such as indian, chinese, japanese, etc. However, i still felt that WITHIN each cuisine, there just wasn't much. For example, sure they had japanese food, but specifically they only had 3 types of rolls and some nigiri. No other types of sashimi, no unique rolls, no tempura, etc etc. \nIn terms of seafood, they had the usual king crab legs, shrimp scampi, and oysters, but it wasn't any different from what you would find in any other decent buffet. \nIn terms of how they serve you the food, it's a little strange: they have their food on smallerl serving plates. While this may give an impression that the dishes are more fresh and replenished more frequently, this also causes an inconvenience to the customer when dishes are constantly running out and staff members have to refill it. This means customers waste more time waiting for their food than eating it. \nOn a more positive note, the service was excellent. This is strange just because no one really notices the service or remembers their waiter in a buffet, but mine was so good that i certainly did remember. She was always refilling our drinks, asking if we needed anything, and never late in clearing our used plates. \n\nOverall, if you had a choice of buffets at Las Vegas, I would still opt for Bellagio or Wynn. The price at Aria is similar to that of other upscale hotel buffets (~40 for dinner) and simply doesnt satisfy in terms of variety or taste.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zTCCbg7mGslxACL5KlAPIQ"}

I went in to place an order to go and ended up waiting almost an hour for the food.

I placed an order of Tom yum chicken soup, combination pho, and Vietnamese egg rolls. Not too hard. Yet they made many mistakes. They made the soup Tom yum soup with shrimp instead of chicken. When I told them that it had to be chicken I felt as if the person was frustrated with me by not taking what they had given me. Then after receiving the new order with the chicken soup, I walked out, only to realize that they forgot to put the egg rolls. I walked back in and he apologized and added two extra egg rolls for the bother. I left semi content and ready to finally eat, yet when I opened the bag I noticed they had forgotten the sauces for the pho (siracha and hoisin sauce). I could have survived without them, however what did piss me off was the chicken soup. My boyfriend tried it and the chicken was so chewy, almost raw! I mean I waited so long for this soup to be done twice and expected it to be good only for the soup to be completely inedible and throwing it away. I don't know if I will be back any time soon. Maybe for their boba. It looked fresh. My advice would be check your order when you receive it. It seems that they are prone to making mistakes.

The casino decor looks dated, especially when you compare it to their neighbors, Rio and Palms (both within walking distance). While Gold Coast has made efforts to bring in some improved dining venues within their establishment (Ping Pang Pong, TGIFriday's...), their main buffet (Ports O'Call) is rather bland and sub-par most of the time. But there are benefits that come along with this. No long lines (well, unless you're redeeming a free gift. SUPER LONG line for that.). Off the Strip so easy enough to get to, right off the freeway. As such, it gets an average rating.\n\nBut as a hotel, what makes me a fan of this place is that I keep getting free rooms here (as well as the Fremont), from their bconnected.com player's card program. I've been asked by several people I know why I keep getting these offers, and I don't have any particular answer to respond. It's not like my player's card is on a higher tier; I'm still on the beginning ruby level. I'm not elderly by any stretch of the imagination (unless you think turning 32 is old). Perhaps because I've stayed at several Sam Boyd's casinos before, or that I stink at gambling and are trying to lure me for my money... Nevertheless, free hotel stays is always a plus.\n\nThe latest time made a trip out there (last month), I was pleasantly surprised to see the updated decor of the hotel rooms. Turned out, I was given one of the remodeled premium rooms. Sad that wifi costs about $13-a-day extra though...\n\nThey also have a bowling alley and exercise room that I have yet to try, and outdoor swimming pool/jacuzzi.\n\nThe latest benefit I've seen from the B Connected players card is that they took off 5% off gas prices at Rebel gas stations. So awesome.\n\nI can overlook the negatives of this place because of all my perks. But that's just me. I'm giving this place a 5, but if the day comes where these types of offers stop rolling in for me, expect a downgrade. We shall see.", "type": "review", "business_id": "t0yVlH_n9_eEZskHwr5cnQ"}

They also have a bartender who dresses up like a real life leprechaun on days like St. Paddys Day. \nOn holidays or special events they have a valet service. That's something RARELY offered at Vegas/Henderson bars. The location is large, and the servers and bartenders are beyond nice. However I do wish they had a couple more of them as one of my only complaints is the wait time. I usually see my waitress hustling hard, running table to table- which makes me wonder why there isn't more assistance. A few of their dishes have an Asian flare. The Chinese meatballs are a solid appetizer. The drink prices are comparable to surrounding similar places, but there are a ton of great happy hour specials. \nI love this place.

I did not try all the salads...but I think one salad is enough to go by.\n\nFirst of all, I really really wanted to like this place and give it a 5 star, however, there were a few things that knocked it down. Let's start with some of the awesome things about this place first:\n\n1. The food is pretty darn good. Try the charbroiled chicken with the ginger chutney. Really, anything on the entree side is awesome. I loved the curry as well.\n2. The dumplings are very good. The pork dumplings are pretty standard. The key is to get the buffalo chicken dumplings. This is a great fusion of American and Asian cuisine.\n3. Get the apple pie dumpling for dessert. You'll thank me later. Just do it. It's amazing.\n\nOn top of the great food, the customer service has been great. I observed an interaction where they forgot to give a customer something in their food and the customer came back. The restaurant offered a free soda, which they did not have to do, and the customer was pleasantly surprised and happy with it.\n\nNow, I did have a few complaints. I tried one of their salads and it looked like it had been made a few days back. Normally this isn't a huge deal but the lettuce was turning brown. Not very appetizing. However, the portion size of the salad was plenty and could almost be a meal for most people.\n\nAlso, when I tried the pork belly, it was charred beyond recognition. The sauce and flavor was good but the pork belly was disappointing because it was all burnt.\n\nOverall, I really like this place and it's a great addition to the Fitchburg area. It has a lot of potential and I will be a frequent visitor. Give it a try!", "type": "review", "business_id": "D2A394AkwlntDC5vIbASyg"}

If I only lived closer to Downtown Phoenix, I'd leave my mark on the Lost Leaf in the form of a permanent intaglio of my ass cheeks on a bar stool. \n\nIt's tucked away on a side street in a humble looking home cum art gallery cum bar. It can be a little tricky to find since no sign exists, so keep an eye out for the neon lit open sign.

While it wouldn't be a total bust, you'd be missing out on the warm and inviting ambiance of the Lost Leaf.\n\nThat's really what won me over about this bar. It made me feel downright cozy, with exposed brick and wood, local artist's artwork decorating the walls, and the actual kitchen serving as the bar. The main room is large enough to host a large group, but small enough to be homey. The acoustics are very good (soft talkers rejoice!) and the music playing was loud enough to add to the mood, but nowhere near the point of drowning out conversation. There are a couple rooms in addition to the main bar area that you can duck off into for more intimate conversation, as well as an outdoor patio that's a little on the small side but, super score--there's ceiling fans!\n\nI found the prices to be very reasonable and the service to be unpretentious and helpful.

Writes review one month later. Oops~\n\nHands down LiB was the best music event I've ever been, and trust me, I've been to plenty. The organizers of this event did a great job in terms of lineup, festival set up, food vendors, and ticket pricing! For the price you paid (LiB 2015 headliners were Stevie Wonder, Imagine Dragons, Kendrick effin' Lamar, Carnage, Porter Robinson... need I say more?), you got 100x worth the experience. I paid $270 for all three days and it was amazing!\n\nThe festival was crowded but not packed (o0o0o throwing shade at Hard Summer and Coachella) so you had plenty of dancing room even up front. Especially for a petite person like me, if we're standing shoulder-to-shoulder, back-to-back... all I will be able to see would probably be your shoulder.... But here I didn't have that issue! I didn't even have a problem maneuvering from stage to stage!\n\nOther Pros:\n-festival lines never took too long; there were two entrances to the festival\n-security was respectful and does not manhandle you\n-plenty of water refill stations near and between stages\n-art murals and decorations were spot on\n-concrete! THIS FESTIVAL IS NOT AS DIRTY AS OTHER FESTIVALS #blessed Nothing worse than sweating all day and collecting dirt on your skin as you walk and dance!\n\nCons:\n-I literally cannot think of one. Everything was amazing.\n\nParking costs $45 for the entire weekend but because the festival was located downtown, I just stayed at a nearby hotel (Plaza Casino) and walked there. In fact, most festival goers stay at the Plaza Casino and Hotel. It's not great, but hey, it's 10 minutes walking distance from the festival!\n\nIf I ever had the chance to, I definitely would come back.

I show up and they are busy, so now I have to wait. Not good business practice to make customers wait so long especially when they call ahead to avoid waiting.\n\nFinally I get seated at a pedicure chair and I inform the manicurist that I brought my own manicure kit.

(Just because I'm clean doesn't mean she can be lazy and skip steps!) My nail polish (I brought from home too) was not painted on consistently, so it looks old and fades, instead of fresh and bright. \n\nMoving on to hands, she places bowl of water on my lap to soak fingers (not very relaxing) while she begins to work literally on top of me. No joke she is standing over me cutting my cuticles in the air. Well of course this is uncomfortable for me and she ends up cutting me really bad (my fingers still hurt as I type this review). I guess by this time she is hungry or something because she rushed through my French tip polish and it looks sloppy and unprofessional. So $40 later it's time to leave, I'm super disappointed I wasted my time and money at this salon. \n\nRecap:\n\n- Customer service is awful, felt disrespected for no reason. \n- Salon atmosphere is awful, chairs are old and ripped, tools look dirty. \n- Prices are comparable, not cheap considering the level of service. \n- Nails also awful, looks very sloppy and unprofessional. \n\nI do not recommend this salon and I will not be returning.", "type": "review", "business_id": "QTatNITIY_WyimPIFpUKeQ"}

The donuts are horrible they should try a new recipe but I can't really judge them based off two items I got but customer service needs work and if they want people coming back and wanting to come back they should try to build a relationship with their customers! I would enjoy going back if they were nice and inviting, also provide fresh bakery items instead of frozen ones.", "type": "review", "business_id": "hfdiI70VeWZPfe-DTQancg"}

It's in the middle of downtown Charlotte, takes eat24 orders (not a popular thing thereabouts), and it offers some nice pizza toppings and a whole wheat crust. But it was decidedly below my (admittedly high) standards for pizza.\n\nThe pizza I got was filling, but the sauce and cheese kind of bland. The peppers and mushrooms I added seemed kind of undercooked (odd, since I specifically checked a box for \"well-done\") and didn't add as much as I'd hoped.\n\nMoreover, it took a solid half hour to get a pizza ready for pickup, and during the half of that time I spent in the store waiting, the people there were oddly apathetic and no one seemed like they wanted to be there.

You might say Tavern Grill is in hospice for now. \n\nI must have forgotten my previous review of the Tavern Grill and went there Saturday night because it was the closest place to my house.  I figured what could be bad about a sports bar on a Saturday night when you don't want to cook.  Well, here's what I learned today about Tavern Grill:\n1.  If you expect to get a slice of tomato on your burger as specified on the menu, don't.  \n2.  If you expect your waiter not to roll his eyes when you point out that there is no tomato, don't .\n3. If you expect the one thin piece of lettuce on your burger not to be super dark green and totally wilted, don't.\n4. If you expect lemon wedges with your seafood order or in your drinking water, don't.\n5.  If you expect your shrimp to be the same size as the breading around it don't.  The size of shrimp inside is smaller than they appear.  Be sure to open wide for the breaded crust.  \n6. If you expect the hot sauces that are brought to you to be clean enough to put your hands around the bottles without getting smutz on your hands, don't.  I should have known better and kept Clorox wipes in my bag for this purpose.\n7.  If you expect your burger to be given to you in one piece and not broken into two for no good reason, don't  Hmmmm.....Did they put two leftover burgers together?\n8.. If you expect the owner to be around so you can talk to him about the quality of the burger, don't. He's in Cottonwood attending to the new hotel he bought.  I hope he makes tons of money there because in a year he'll have to sell Tavern Grill for 10 cents on the dollar.  .  If you expect a sports bar like Tavern Grill to be hopping on a Saturday night, don't.  \n   You could have held a religious service there.

He looks like he is unkempt, and I am frankly surprised PetSmart puts someone like that in a position as Manager...but I don't work there nor own any of their stock so could care less.  I just want a return credit.  Anyway, Mr. Manager  asks me if I bought it all at one time.\nOK...here is where the story just gets stupid, cause the cans are all the same, in the original 24 pack box all wrapped with the plastic they put around it opened only on the top to allow getting about 1-1/2 cans out (if you can imagine how big that hole is).  Taken aback I said to him tongue in cheek (cause it was getting humorous to me at this point), \"Uh...isn't that indicative?\" while pointing to the boxed canned kinda smiling (I mean, it was obvious to me that only the plastic at the top had broken into that flat of canned cat food).  Upon which his response to me was, \"Well, you don't have to be rude, and if you want me to take these back you better be a little nicer to me.\"  \nYou know, I am older and have been in many situations taking things back when it was absolutely necessary, and not once has anyone ever responded like that that I ever remember.  Is he touchy?  Or is he just a smartass fat guy who thinks he has a little power now?  Or is he just burnt out on working there?  Who knows?  \nAnyway, I told him to just give me my things back and I would donate it..and walked out....never to return to PetSmart again.  \nWhat can I say other than I felt he has alot to learn and was ridiculous in his actions and certainly nobody I ever want to deal with again.\nMaybe if Mr. Manager got a new haircut and a shave he would be in a more friendly customer service mood...ya think?\n\nUPDATE:  After multiple emails to PetSmart Customer Service Department where their \"great\" idea was for me to call the store and voice my experience to the Manager...really?  This could be the guy who was such a jackass, so why do I want to talk to him again?  Customer Service headquarters doesn't read your emails or has no brains and caring for their customers, which doubly makes me glad I am not going there ever again.  Bye, bye, PetSmart!

I love tapas and the menu looked so promising...carpaccio with truffle oil, grilled octopus with a red wine reduction, and chorizo clams in a white wine broth.  My mouth waters just thinking about these dishes and many more on Barcelona's menu, but I'm sad to report that this was one of the most disappointing restaurants I've ever been to!\n\nIt just so happens that I recently acquired a coupon to this restaurant and went to it last Friday.  I just want to make it clear that I would have happily tried this place at full price, and the dish I was looking most forward to trying was the carpaccio (you just can't go wrong with raw beef and truffle oil...I'd hope).  My boyfriend and I were seated and greeted promptly.  When the server came over to take our drink order, he looked down at my coupon, took it and went straight to the kitchen.  Being a server for a long time, I could tell he was not happy that we brought this coupon, but I tried to remedy the situation by being extremely nice.  We ordered the carpaccio, pan fried dates, steamed clams, diabla shrimp, grilled octopus, saut\u00e9ed tilapia, albondigas, and merguez.  After a short while the tapas started coming out, and after delivering the first wave, our server said, \"I'm sorry, but the carpaccio is very popular and we are running out of it tonight.\"  I smiled and said disappointed, \"oh really?\" and he responded, \"yes.\"  Both my boyfriend and I picked up on his wording, but we did not confront him about it.  It is my strong belief that they had enough carpaccio for AT LEAST another order, but they didn't want to waste it on a table with a coupon!  As the night progressed our server grew increasingly more impatient and annoyed with our presence.  When we got our check he had manually written in an 18% tip...on a table for 2, and I always automatically tip 20% (even when the service is bad)!  With a coupon or something comped, I usually tip much more because that's what fellow service industry workers do...(can you tell how livid I am?)  Unfortunately, I wish I could say that only the service was sub par, but the food ranged from ok to not even edible.\n\nPan Fried Dates- This was the best dish we had from Barcelona.  The bacon was cooked well, all of the textures were spot on, and they had a nice savory sweet taste.  However, the red wine reduction was way too thin, the blue cheese crumbles were on the stingy side, and Firefly's are much better.\n\nSteamed Clams- The clams were cooked well, but the chorizo was very dry.  The broth also needed more seasoning (this is a common theme).\n\nDiabla Shrimp- I liked this, but again, it was not as good as Firefly's.  A nice spicy sweet sauce with shrimp, but the sauce was a little too thin.\n\nGrilled Octopus- This just lacked seasoning.  The octopus was a pretty good texture, not too chewy, but the flavor was bland.  For good grilled octopus, try Olives in the Bellagio.\n\nSauteed Tilapia- Completely inedible!  I'm not sure if the kitchen just didn't care or if they genuinely made a mistake, but the outside of the fish was mushy and the inside was raw.  I've never seen fish this texture before, and I honestly can't think of how it happened.\n\nAlbondigas- Meatballs in marinara with melted mozzarella on top.  These were so dry we drenched each bite in the marinara.\n\nMerguez- A spicy lamb sausage served over roasted red pepper couscous.  The sausage was dry and not very spicy.

So thereafter, I called my waiter back over, only to be informed, \"It is now five, and we have them.  We never know before hand.\"\n\nIf you have \"stone crab\" in your restaurant's name, I suggest you get on top of the availability of primary menu items.  I felt like a character in the Monty Python cheese shop skit.\n\nMy waiter informed me he would comp me for the scallops (which were pretty meh... 15 or more on the plate, too tough, too salty).  When the bill arrived, I was comped instead for a slice of pie (Marie Callander style frozen pie with cardboard crust) and a cup of coffee.\n\nI hope my experience was out of the ordinary, but I paid $80 for dinner for one, and felt like I could have had a better experience for that price at a dozen other places in Vegas.

She just sort of rubbed the shampoo around lightly and washed it out and did the same with the conditioner.

At this point I was feeling frustrated, I could've washed my hair better than this but I was already in too deep.

She held the brush and blow dryer awkward and just sort of \"made it work.\" Several times while she was drying my hair the heat was insanely hot on my scalp and I had to pull my head away.

Upon picking up my car after it was \"finished\" I was VERY DISAPPOINTED. Here is why:\n\n1) They didn't fix the chipped paint, they just used silver paint from a bottle and brushed it onto the damaged parts of my car.\n\n2) My rear-taillight had black tint over it and upon getting my car back one of my taillights was still tinted, and the one they replaced WASN'T... They tried to tell me that \"taillight tint is illegal\"... they just wanted an excuse to not finish my car.\n\n3) They removed the weather-proof-sealant from the external roof of my car, and did not put it back where it belongs. It was just sitting in the back seat with masking tape on it that read \"front\" (I assume so they would remember where to put it back, but didn't) Because of this, water has been leaking through my ceiling for the past 2 months.\n\n4) They removed a bungie cord hook from my trunk, and didn't put it back when they finished so I can no longer section-off my trunk into compartments.\n\n*****5) Ever since I got my car back, there was a slow leak in my front left tire... I finally took it to the tire repair shop this afternoon... They told me that \"Someone put a nail in your tire and removed it to make it look like an accident\"  Seems like an AWFULLY HUGE coincidence to go along with all of the other things listed above that went wrong.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nBe sure to check your car VERY THROUGHLY upon pick-up.

First off, we were unfortunate enough to get a table with the stools with no backs.  So, there was no lounging in a relaxed posture while enjoying our wine.  Secondly, the stools were too high for the table which means you have to stoop down to eat in a very awkward way.  Third, they had live music.  The guitar player/singer was actually really good but they had a full amp and speaker system even though it is a pretty small place and so this made it very difficult to carry on a conversation with the other couple we were with.\n\nI didn't feel comfortable enough to eat a full dinner since the height made it difficult to use utensils so I just got appetizers.  The red pepper hummus was good but the plain one was not too good.  I also tried the potstickers - fun to try something different (they were made with crocodile meat) but nothing to write home about.  My husband got the Roo burger which he said had a good taste but a weird texture.  I also tried one of the bruschetta pieces that someone else in our party had ordered.  I love brie but this one was nothing really special.  They had a variety of bruschetta options but they were pretty much the same options that have become trendy with all the wine bars in the valley that I have been to.  I think the best part of the meal was actually the sweet potato fries that came with my husband's burger.  These were really, really good.\n\nTwo of us also got the evening's tasting flight.

We were trying to get home from Savannah, GA at were detoured through all the flooding as highways were shut down. After 7 hours on the road (should have been 4 hour trip), we stopped and got a room still 3 hours from home.  I'm a rewards member and we've stayed at Holiday Inns many times without any concerns.\n\nI asked the front desk clerk for a room with 2 beds because of the children we had with us.  We were given Room 206.  We unpacked and went for a quick dinner.   \n\nWhen we returned to the hotel after dinner and upon reaching our floor, we were confronted by police officers saying we had to leave the floor.  We told them our room number and said we needed our things because they contained diapers and formula for our son.  He told us to go back to the front desk and get a different room or stay in another hotel because there was a sting operation in room 208 (right next to our room!).  He said there would be a police officer escort us to get our things.\n\nThe front desk clerk told us he was aware of the police action when he checked us in but he was not allowed to say anything.  I asked the clerk if he was aware the police activity was occurring in Room 208 and he said he was.  I asked why then he thought it was a good idea to put us in Room 206 right next door.  Out of all the rooms in the hotel, this guy put a family with 2 small kids in the room right next to a drug sting operation involving the DEA and local police!!!\n\nWe asked to change rooms and were told there would be an extra $20.00 charge.  I told the clerk to drop the charge and change our room or we would leave.  He begrudgingly dropped the charge.\n\nThe next day around 5PM, I received a call from someone claiming to be the manager of the hotel.  She apologized and asked if we were okay.  I told her it was a scary situation especially to my kids and my daughter was still talking about it.  She said she wanted to help make things right and was going to talk to \"corporate\" and get back to me. She assured me she would be in contact again in \"no more than 24 hours\" and that she \"wanted to do the right thing\".  I never heard from her again.\n\nWe filed a complaint on the IHG website figuring corporate would like to know how their franchises are doing and never heard from anyone there either.\n\nThe most appalling thing to us is that the hotel and, more specifically, the clerk on duty were aware of the police activity yet still chose to put a family with kids in the room right next door.  Even the police on scene commented that no one should have been booked in our room.\n\nI appreciate that Holiday Inn cooperates with the police to make our world a better place, but they need to do so only while ensuring the health and safety of their customers.  The apparent lack of protocol is astounding!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "rdL8afisA5KJIaUJmOa4pw"}

I was eagerly anticipating my visit and even had spoken with my colleagues about going. We were staying at the Flamingo so the location was ideal for us to visit for breakfast. There were 12 of us that went in and when told it was a 40 minute wait 8 decided to go elsewhere. The remaining 4 decided we would wait; you only get to Vegas so often; right? We waited for 40 minutes and we were finally seated. Everything is okay so far. The menu looked fantastic and I had already made up my mind I was having the chicken and waffles. I could not wait!! We ordered coffees and water and then our meals. The menu states clearly \"please be patient, everything is made from scratch and can take time to prepare\"; I am more than okay with this. I am willing to wait for fabulous, fresh food. This is where things began to deteriorate rapidly. Our waitress while bubbly was inattentive or inefficient at her occupation or both. We asked for refills on coffee; after waiting for 10 mins for her to notice we needed more. She said that she had some brewing. Okay, no problem. Two seconds later my wife notices other servers pouring coffee for their customers. After another 5 mins we wave her down again and ask for more coffee. She says \"sure!\" as if the previous request never happened. Several minutes later the coffee finally came. Water glasses were never refilled without having to track someone down and ask. Same with the coffee. This went on for 40-45 mins while waiting for food. The food finally started to come out. First was my wife's pancake. A couple of minutes later the french toast came out for one of us and then a few minutes later the BLT that was ordered; sans the fries. Then a few minutes after that my chicken and waffles came out. Now as I stated I am cool with the 40 minute wait for fresh food; but in that time frame you should be able to get an entire table of four all served at the same time. So, we all start to dig in. My wife's pancake is huge and looks great. They gave her a thimble full of syrup for a pancake that is the size of Texas. No problem; just ask for more. We had to ask again after it never came. My dining companions were enjoying the french toast and the BLT. Still no fries. I was taking on the chicken and waffles. They did not come with any syrup. They did come with a \"maple reduction sauce\" unfortunately it was reduced to nothing. The waffles were good and had bacon in the middle but they were dry without the necessary syrup to get them down. Asked for syrup again. Waited. It finally came. My friend was done with the BLT. No fries...asked for them and they finally came out. Asked for more coffee and water. Waited. Finally got it. So as you can imagine our table discussion this entire time has been how disappointed we all have been with our experience. My friend Mark finally asked for the manager and voiced his concerns with our experience. The manager apologized and left. A few minutes later Mark caught him again and asked for his business card and said \"I'm a letter writer\". The manager gave him the card and then came back to the table and took his BLT and the drinks off of the bill. Smart move. Took a little prodding but it was a smart move. We could not wait to pay and get out. I would not make the effort to go back. My new name for this place is \"Hash House A No Go\" and I will leave it at that.

But it doesn't give me the HotPot vibe.  It  was pretty empty when I went there for dinner and it's a Southeast Asian decor.  And I thought Hot Pot is mainly a Chinese thing.  \n\nI had the Ying Yang pot (spicy and plain on the two sides of the pot).  The pork broth produces a strong flavor for the soup.  All the spices in the two sides made the base very strong and flavorful.  Actually it almost seemed a bit too heavy for my taste. And the spicy side is very spicy (at least to me).  For the additional sauces they had their own version of soy sauce and a peanut sauce.  It was a bit sweet for my taste, so I didn't use it that much.  But the meat and vegetables dipped in the broth was definitely enough for flavor.  The napa especially soaked up the spicy broth very nicely.  I like drinking the broth after the meal to relax my stomach, but the strong broth is more like a starter soup instead of an ending soup.\n\nWe had the shabu beef and lamb.  They were sliced thinly, but the meat just didn't seem as tender as I would like it.  And the portions were very very small.  The presentation/dishes were very nice, but the food quality just isn't there.\n\nIf you like strong broth flavors, then you can try this place.  But honestly, as far as Hot Pot goes, this place is very expensive with very little portions.  For the price we paid, we could have gone to Texas Roadhouse for a prime rib.  The food provided is about average as well.  If you can't travel to California and you have a craving Hot Pot, then I guess this is the only alternative.

Also, When I checked in the lady was rude and said they were not allowed to put a rollaway in my room even though there was plenty of space AND I had already reserved and paid for it prior to arrival. (As a matter of fact, the reservation required me to reserve it because we had 6 people and it said the max to room was 5 without the rollaway.)  She then proceeded to tell me she called her manager and her manager told her the couch was the \"rollaway\" bed we reserved and argued with me when I explained that a couch and rollaway were not the same. Very rude girl, allowed her kids behind the counter even when she was not there with them. When a customer walks in the door, it is not a very good impression when the first thing they see is a boy approx 10 years old behind the counter. We were very tired when we came in and had to deal with this for 45 min. She finally agreed to bring the bed up, and when we received it, it was tied together with trash bags??  The hall floor was dirty with spots, and we didn't even bother with breakfast. I had to keep socks on my children because the floor was so dirty in the room.  When I received my bill under the door in the morning, they had added another rollaway on to my bill so it had charges for 2 rollaways instead of the 1. When we went to leave in the morning, the same lady was working the front again.I spoke with her about it and she said she fixed it. I asked for another receipt and all she had done was charge $10 less on our bill, and our bill was still showing we had a $10 balance for the other rollaway. At this point, I was done dealing with her and wasting my time. She said her manager would be there soon, so we went to eat and went back in an hour to talk to Que the manager. The front desk lady said Que had come and already left in the hr we were gone but would call me later. This was even more upsetting because we could have been on the road driving. We hung around specifically to speak with her. Overall, this was the worse stay we have ever had at a Choice hotel and we stay at them quite often.

They also did not clean up or clear off the table next to us the entire time we were there. We sat next to a dirty cluttered table full of dirty dishes the whole time.

There noticeably were only a couple of patrons.\n\n\"You're not allowed to be here,\" the greeter barked at us sternly.\n\n\"Oh, we're just here for coffee,\" my friend replied as she stopped dead in her tracks.\n\n\"Under 21 only,\" deadpanned the greeter.\n\nWe were bewildered as we pulled out our IDs for her inspection. The greeter should have simply asked for our IDs rather than assume we were all under 21. Besides, I know Asians look young, but really? I'm 34, and the last educated guess at my age was 27. Seriously speaking, I appreciate the compliment, but the way it was given was certainly not orthodox.\n\nThe four of us were then seated at living room style couches and sofas. As we did not receive menus, we had to flag down the hostess again for that reason. I ordered a tangerine smoothie while my friends ordered alcoholic mixed beverages. \n\nAnother oddity occurred when we went up to the counter to order pastries after ordering our drinks with the server. The hostess at the counter took my friends order of two pastries and asked if they could be placed in the same bag since they were out of bags. My friend agreed.\n\nBut then I placed my order, saying that she could place it in a napkin if need be. She nodded her head. I received my order in a bag identical to the ones they were allegedly out of, along with a napkin and utensils all wrapped in plastic. Strange.\n\nSo we received our drinks. My friends' alcoholic beverages were average and nothing special, while my smoothie was not a smoothie. It was shaved italian ice colored orange and loaded with a large quantity of sugar. The aftertaste reeked (not even tasted, reeked) of sweetness from the sugar. If I wanted a Slurpee, I would have chosen to instruct the server to obtain my beverage from the 7-11 next door. \n\nAt one point, we found that we could not find our server once again. Eventually, my friend located her... sitting in a customer's chair in front of a slot machine, smoking a cigarette. Ok, I understand a smoke break, but in front of the customers? \n\nOn the way out, I noticed a machine that produced the different colored so-called \"smoothies.\" It was similar to those used to make frozen ice desserts. I shook my head. We waved and yelled out our good nights but, not surprisingly, we were not acknowledged at all.\n\nI would be open to trying this place again if the management responds actively to this review. Perhaps the off-peak staff is simply staff-in-training. \n\nUntil then, I can get better smoothies at McDonald's for a fraction of the cost.\n\nTwo stars minus one star for the service = one star.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Vatj2G_VEjhLoUlAnCDQPw"}

I asked if they had some other salsa, and they brought me a ketchup flavored bowl of yuck.... On to the main course... I ordered the beer battered shrimp tacos, thinking the seafood tacos would be their star dish.  The tortillas were fried, the shrimp had no flavor, and it just tasted greasy and bland.

So I decided to go ask some people sitting at the tables who the host/ess was and how to get seated and served, they said they didn't know because they had been sitting there being ignored for 20 minutes. I tried going to the bar and was promptly ignored. Finally I decided that his place did not deserve my patronage and left in a real uproar, throwing down their menu in frustration after a very long attempt that was very much in vain. Sadly I don't think they can actually go bankrupt due to their location, but I will certainly wish they get closed for some other reason (either health violations or serving alcohol to minors) because they certainly deserve it.

We came to Charlotte for a three day convention and this hotel was conveniently located to the convention center. \n\nThe only good thing I will say about our stay was that the first person we dealt with was very pleasant. We booked a room with two queen bed because we had friends staying with us for one night. The room we got had a king size bed and a gross looking pull out couch. There other rooms we supposedly booked so we had to deal with it. \n\nThe room itself was very hot and we had to call maintenance to come look at the HVAC. When he came he had to go in the ceiling and switch the unit from heat to ac because the units were the same units they installed in the 80's and you have to manually switch from heat to cool. He let us now that the room would more than likely get cold in the evening because the temp that night was supposed to get down in the 40's but he would gladly come back. It did indeed get cold. \n\nThe beds where not as bad as in the other reviews but if two people sat on the edge of the bed then the whole bed actually flipped up and put you on the floor. The floors by the way really need to be steam cleaned. I walked around in my socks and they were brown after just a few minutes. Very nasty. \n\nThey give you three bath towels and have signs up that ask you to reuse your towels. That is fine but with four people we requested more towels and additional bedding for the pull out bed. After an hour a gentleman finally brought up just sheets. They were hot which made it seemed like they were washed when we called. A large hotel does not have sheets clean and ready to go? I called again to get towels but no one came. It was late so we just gave up. In the morning I just went and got them myself. \n\nWe barely slept at all the whole time because the walls are paper thin and all we heard all night was sirens which sound like they are right outside your window. \n\nThe whole time I stayed there I thought I was getting sick because I was stuffed up and sneezing. Did not start until the evening we checked in. On the day of check out I happened to glance up at the vent close to the ceiling and was absolutely horrified to see black mold growing on the bathroom wall. I took a paper towel to see if it was just dust but it was not. I informed the front desk but they just insisted it could not possibly be mold. Not one person even offered to go look. I will be reporting this hotel. \n\nIn summation.... AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!!!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "74dAKJ9Lx0cYmb3GOxdFEA"}

The cheese was cold and lumpy and the bead was burnt, pears had pieces of seeds in them that we had to pick out. Then after waiting another 25 minutes our order for dinner was taken, Our salad arrived (the Original Chopped Salad) which was the highlight of the night. It Was AMAZING! We then waited another 35 minutes for our dinner to finally arrive. What was laid before us was astonishing. It looked like 2 very small appetizers. I couldn't believe it. Then came the desert, It was tasteless and bland (peach cobbler/bread pudding). I was in SHOCK! So then we waited another 20 Minutes for the check, looked at it and nothing was priced as being advertised for the Happy Hour.

Plus their service is flat out rude. And if you don't want to take my word for it then take the Health District's word for it. THEY GOT CLOSED IN JUNE TWICE FOR FAILING THEIR HEALTH INSPECTION.

It's not like a buffet where we are trying to get lunch prices for a dinner buffet..it's the same shiz.  One last person arrived at 2:59 and they made a stink that HE absolutely had to pay the dinner price.

The first time I went there they started bringing rolls no one ordered and when we said that they argued with us then and put it on our table anyway. This business does not know how to pick their battles or treat their customers.

I did not find their method of training particularly effective. I also was not impressed with the trainer and found her actually pretty rude. I know she did not like the way I was training my dog (I reward frequently and set my pup up to perform a behavior successfully instead of waiting for her to do the wrong thing so I can yank on her leash. Instead, Masters kennels wants your dog to do things wrong so you can correct them - this is something I not only observed but was also essentially told this by the teacher.), and that's fine for them, I don't expect them to teach their class based on what I think is correct.. But since I paid them, did expect to be treated respectfully by the trainer and was not. Infact she was rude. I think their method of training expects too much of puppies too quickly and requires owners to repeatedly correct their dogs for not doing behaviors that the dogs haven't really even learned. It's not effective to give your dog a correction for a behavior it doesn't know. An example of how discouraging this method of training is for puppies was when the teacher selected dogs to demonstrate and every single dog she selected each and every time was frightened of her and unable to effectively demo. Training should be rewarding for dog and owner. It should not involve endless ineffective corrections and fear. This is not a fun training class for your puppy. A puppies first exposure to training should be positive, fun, and full of rewards - you won't get this at masters kennels.

There were quite a few good sushi restaurants back home, and I was looking forward to trying and finding some good ones out here in Las Vegas. So, after a quick scan on yelp, we decided to check out Sushi Fever.\n\nNow, I haven't tried any sushi from anywhere else here in Las Vegas yet, but compared to places I've been previously, this was easily one of the worst. We went on a Saturday afternoon, around 1 o'clock, and the place was moderately busy. Our service was a little on the slow side, but not the worst I've experienced. Our food, however, was a very big disappointment, especially for the price. The rolls average around $14, and based on the quality and quantity they give, I'd put their value closer to $7-$8. We ordered 2 Miso Soups, 1 order of steamed Gyoza, 1 order of yellowtail nigiri, 1 kamikaze hand-roll, 1 yum yum hand-roll, 1 Mistake specialty roll, 1 Volcano specialty roll, and just water to drink. The bill was $54. I'd probably rate this place a 2 - 2.5 star establishment if the bill was closer to $30.\n\nAs for our food, the miso soup was extremely bland, with an over powering taste of onion. I'm not sure how they managed to screw up miso soup, but they did. There was a lot of tofu though, so that may or may not be a bonus for some people. The gyoza was a limp sack of spinach, with a mediocre sauce on the side. We ate half of them before deciding we'd rather be hungry than continue eating those. The yellowtail nigiri was alright, nothing special, nothing terrible. The kamikaze hand-roll was definitely on the lower end of hand-rolls I've had, and all of the cream cheese was on the bottom for some reason, so the last bite was exceptionally bad. The yum yum hand-roll also managed to have an overpowering oniony taste somehow, despite me not actually seeing any onions. The mistake specialty roll was on par with a Vons brand spicy tuna roll, except this one looking like it was rolled by someone with tremors. Finally, the volcano specialty roll. This was easily the best thing we ordered off the menu, but it came out 10 minutes after the rest of our food, cost $12, and we only got 4 medium sized pieces of sushi. Plus, it was a baked roll, despite not mentioning that on the menu, which sadly my fiancee doesn't like.\n\nI don't know if this place just has off days or what, but we definitely won't be coming back. I've generally been pretty pleased with the restaurant scene out here, and I was pretty surprised at how bad the food was for the price. I hope the other nearby sushi bars can do better.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tQQxehL2ZVGp7MqAxtSU_g"}

During my stay my boothmate and I began receiving huge red itchy welts which were bug bites from insects in the ballroom. I went to the concierge who took me into the business center to speak with the manager Kyle King, who apologized and said he would immediately come down to the ballroom to assess the situation. Unfortunately nobody ever came to deal with the insect problem and we continued to receive bites and ended up with around a dozen bites each from our feet up to our knees. The bites were so itchy that they kept us both up at night for a week even while constantly applying medication. I later spoke with a nurse who said that they appeared to be flea bites and that the hotel needed to take action with the problem since flea bites can become infected from the feces fleas leave while on our skin and if they are scratched can lead to scarring.\n\nAfter the event, I called the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak Resort and asked to speak to a manager about this issue. Nobody would connect me to a manager and asked why I needed to speak to a manager in the first place. I explained what had happened during my stay on the property and was told they would find the manager Kyle King I had spoken with and connect me to him. I was put on hold for more than ten minutes and then was told I was going to be connected to the Director of Security, who told me he would get Kyle King's contact information and call me back with that information so I could e-mail photographs of the bug bites I received from my stay on the property. The Director of Security called me back and said his boss wouldn't allow him to give me a managers contact information.\n\nAfter this I e-mailed the resort and was told that since I didn't pay to stay in a hotel room and only paid to stay in the Hohokam Ballroom that they couldn't do anything about it even though this happened on their property and they did nothing about it. And speaking of rooms, I later was informed that some individuals that stayed in hotel rooms on the property during the same time had issues with ants swarming in their rooms which ended up getting into their luggage.\n\nOverall I think it is ridiculous that the hotel wouldn't do anything about the bugs and also that nobody would let me speak to a manager when I had a complaint. I expected a clean and safe environment to be in at the resort, but the resort has bug problems in several different areas which need to be attended to for the safety and health of the guests.", "type": "review", "business_id": "N1xMSUfv1GmfHGa9a3VuJw"}

It had a smear of avocado, a few shreds of white cabbage, a few shreds of cheese and a drizzle of \"white cilantro sauce\" which was so scant that I couldn't even taste it.

Again, I called the front desk, they assured me they were on their way. 30 min later there was a knock on my door. \n\nWe then head out to dinner. Our friend arrives at the hotel while we are out. He gives the front desk both his and my name. They give him the room key - no problems there. He then gets to the room, unpacks, showers, shaves, grabs a drink from the mini bar and takes off to meet us at the casino. Long story short...About 2 hrs later we figure out that the front desk had given him the wrong room key (directed him to the wrong room). All this time he was showering and settling in to a room that wasn't his - luckily the owners of the room hadn't returned since he had arrived. We immediately went to speak to the front desk about this - they lightheartedly apologized (as if it was funny). Not the reaction I was expecting. They brought over another gentleman who claimed to be a \"manager,\" all he did was briefly apologize. He did not seem too interested in making sure we were satisfied. \n\nbtw...all of this happened on my girlfriend's bday weekend. \n\nI expected much more from this hotel.

We couldn't sell the house we decided to rent it out. I guess when a property is rented the owner is still responsible for trash. Trash bills supposedly kept coming, but no one ever got them. Republic Services never made any attempts to contact me, just kept letting the bills, liens, and court fees piling up. \n\n3 years down the road, our tenant is gone and we are trying to do a short sale on the place.

They keep citing the \"City Ordinance\" that required this (Its true, I looked it up. LVCO 9.08.210 paragraph (B)). I called NV Energy, since the power is under the tenants name, they cannot give me the bill, or even release it to Rep Services. So I have to track down the tenant (property manager was NO help- look for another review on them coming soon!) myself, get her to get a copy of the bill, send it to me, so I can send it to Rep Services. It took me months, but I was finally able to get it, now they are saying it's not the right one, it doesn't say FINAL BILL on it, etc...  I get the run around every time I call. Meanwhile, I'm still stuck paying for trash service at an empty house, and my short sale is being help up even more than normal because of this. \n\nWhat really pisses me off is that Republic Services has not make ONE attempt to contact me, send me a bill, or notice, replied to an email, nothing!

It had hambuger paper on the bottom.  The chicken was a small breast of chicken and sauce poured on top.  It came with a scoop of rice.  No wonder I didnt hear any cooking, It was basically a pre-cooked chicken breast and they warmed up the sauce and poured it on top.  My friend's beef version was probably in a cooker and they just scooped it into the box and served it.  Was pretty weak in my opinion.\n\nI questioned about the appe-teaser and the guy looked at his order sheet and said that he was sorry and will get it out right away.  He did but it was so drenched in oil that the lumpia was quite soft.  Looks like the oil wasnt up to temperature and it just soaked it all up and became soggy.  \nAgain, he was aplogetic and very nice about it.  \n\nUnfortunately, I wouldnt recommend.

Once it took them three weeks to fix it so my blinds are all wrinkly. My friend's ceiling leaked, her window popped out one windy day and almost hit her in the head, my light bulbs are always going out, the locks in my bedroom were broken when I moved in, my front door handle is so stiff, guests can't get in or out of my house lol, the hot tub infinity pool is broken often...

One of my friends suggested Barley's. We met around 11:30am and the place was already pretty busy. my friends found us seats and waited for the waitress. She came over after a bit of time, and when one of my friend asked about specials she never said anything about pitchers being $5. Incidentally, she also charged me $4 for a bloody Mary that I think should have been $3 but I didn't find out until later so we it go. Bloody Mary's were not that good either, but what does I expect from a casino bar? \nWe knew it was busy so we tried to give her some slack. She finally brought the drinks and then we never saw her again. After over 25 minutes I finally decided to write our food order down and take it to her. I found her in the service well and asked her if it would help and handed her the order. She was rude and told me that it actually didn't help and then asked the other waitress to deal with me. Her whole side of the conversation was very rude. At this point I no longer wanted her as my server. \nThe new waitress, Amber was very nice. She told me it actually did help and went through the order with me to ensure she had it correct. Even though Amber was busy she always had a smile on her face. \n\nWe ended up ordering most of our drinks from the bar because they were so busy. In my opinion they either should have had another waitress or had one of the bartenders help them. \n\nThe food was OK. One of my friends ordered the chicken sandwich she said it was OK. I ordered scrambled eggs and breakfast potatoes. The breakfast potatoes were kinda bland, but whatever we were starving and it was good enough. \n\nThe male food server/busser was excellent and very helpful.

You would have though I had taken a hammer to it with their reaction. I was admiring their selection and not reading all the little signs about not touching anything.

An Egg Chair. You would have thought he sounded like a babbling idiot because their answers where so pretentious and condescending. He asked about other things they had in the store and they had the same cold attitude everyone else on here talks about.  \n\nAnyway, I'm assuming that the majority of the their actual customers come from web sales because there is no way anyone I know would spend that kind of money on furniture when the sales staff is acting like they're doing you a favor by allowing you to breath in their precious vintage air.", "type": "review", "business_id": "xWcTt1L4vQC_QkPfPBVlCw"}

I have to say their flat bread pizza was just ok, nothing special, but it's the cheapest thing on the menu and definitely filling.

We spent 5 minutes here and then I couldn't stand it anymore!  Awful place, I hope you will avoid it after reading my review.  Go to XS or Marquee!!!!

I jumped in my car I raced up there and before I bought one I spoke with the two employees who were working for close to an hour and I kept asking are you sure its authentic if its an authentic how are you getting it for so cheap because at the time this mod was going for over $200 and they just kept telling me the same thing over and over again, we buy so many of these we get them extremely discounted and like an idiot I believed them. I bought one and I raced back home, took the back off to put my battery in and that's when I noticed it was a clone. I take it back to the store the same day and as soon as I walk through that door the employee looks at me and goes it's a clone isn't it? He knew it was a clone he lied to me so God only knows how many other people they lied to thankfully he gave me my money back without much of a fight. This all happened 12 months ago just yesterday the owner of the company replied to my year old message telling me that I'm a liar and I don't have a membership to their store that's funny because how would he know if I had a membership for not considering he doesn't know my last name and this took place a year ago. The owner sent me a private message telling me I was fat and I had double chin and he somehow got my original post removed so I'm putting this back up.

Dinner took another 20 plus minutes and three trips to serve 5 of the 6 guests. My friend's burger made multiple trips around the restaurant while I waited for a condiment that should have been on my veggie burger. By the time I got it my food was cold, and the fries weren't crispy to begin with. My mom's food was lukewarm but she was a good sport about it. When my  friend finally asked where her burger was she was told it was coming, and then the waitress asked her what it was that she ordered. Then a burger came, the wrong burger - hers was the one making laps around the diner. So they bring her that very burger, not a fresh one, but the one that has been to every table but ours and is now ice cold (they did comp it), but Jeeze, make a fresh burger!!!!

I was incredibly excited to finally have the cut done and to have the opportunity to speak with someone else who I felt understood curly hair. Robert was nice, but kind of impersonal and he had tried to book his next appointment too close to my appointment time so his next client showed up half way through my cut. When that happened, he pawned me off on his assistant who told me she was still in school for cosmetology and she very clearly had no clue how to handle curly hair. I ended up having to tell her to stop touching me and to just let me do it because I had plans right after that and I was not about to go out looking like a troll. I'm sure Robert could tell I was very unhappy and he kept making bogus excuses as for why my hair looked so awful rather than just apologizing and finishing it.

Don't deal with them unless you have no alternative!\n\nLike many Pittsburghers, I'm stuck with Comcast because they have a contract on my apt. building.  (This is called a monopoly, by the way!)  Otherwise, I'd probably deal with Verizon.  While I've heard their customer service can also be dicey at times, I don't think it's as consistently horrible as Comcast's.\n\nLast week, I had a billing issue that needed to be resolved over the phone.  If you think they're swifter in the billing dept., think again!  I sat on hold for 20 min. before talking to a live operator, and then I was transferred, after which I sat on the phone another 5 min.  When I finally talked to someone in billing, they were helpful, and resolved the problem within 5 min.  This begs the question, why in tarnation did I just sit on the phone waiting for 25 min.?  Based on my other experiences, this is par for the course, to the point that I refuse to call them unless absolutely necessary.  They do have an online chat service, which I recommend over their \"customer service\" line.\n\nIn the past, I had an issue with one of their techs, who showed up earlier than the beginning of the time window stated, despite that I chose that time window to coincide with when I left work.  (Note: this was one of Comcast's own techs.) I had to rush home from work to let the tech in and avoid being charged for a no-show.  This tech, who installed my service, was totally incompetent, and couldn't get my router to work with the modem he provided, even after 45 min. of trying.  My friend, a computer scientist, was able to get them to work together in about 5 min.  When I moved apartments and had to get the service reinstalled, the tech who came that time, who was with a subcontractor (ACI), was great--he showed up on time and got the modem and router to work together within about 15 min.\n\nIf you have to sign up for a plan with them, be sure to read the fine print.  Like anther reviewer, I signed up for a plan that started at $30/month, and then increased after 6 mos., and again after 1 yr.  I knew this when I signed up, so I asked the representative who I dealt with if there was any penalty for downgrading to a less expensive plan with lower bandwidth, and she said there wasn't.  As the end of my first year of service approached, I asked to be downgraded so that I wouldn't have to pay more than double the starting rate, and this was done without a problem. Now I pay \"only\" $50/month for about half as much bandwidth as I had to begin with.  Fortunately, I'm not a Netflix consumer--otherwise, I'd probably be frustrated to no end.\n\nI don't have cable, so I can't personally speak to picture quality, etc.  However, my parents, who used to have Comcast, switched to FIOS about 5 years ago and have been pretty happy with the service, and haven't looked back.  I'm sure I would have done so by now, too, if I had any choice in the matter!", "type": "review", "business_id": "I6ZvkRYvzdcYp6QFjQ3-aA"}

Added the line to an existing line through the Internet last night. $40 was authorized, $80 is taken out of my account today. \n\nTried to contact customer service by telephone. Was told I needed to come to the store because I did not remember my high security code. Went to the store and was told they took $80, $40 to start the new line and $40 was applied to the next months bill. They never did explain why they took more than what was authorized. I authorized $40, not $80 and wanted a refund of the $40 that was not authorized. \n\nSomebody, I'm assuming a supervisor or manager, was called over the telephone for assistance. Can't do anything but they can send a check for the other $40....like I would trust Metro to do that. And I was informed the supervisor was at lunch. Well, I was too. \n\nSo I get back to work and try again to call the telephone customer service. Was told the same story....$40 should have come out; however, $80 did, no explanation why. Was transferred to a company named Bill Matrix, apparently they take care of Internet transactions. They said they can't help me other than refund the entire $80, which will take 7-10 days and they would need Metro to authorize the refund. \n\nI was supposed to receive a $30 rebate prepaid card. That hasn't happened. When I go on line to check the status, it says it was approved for final processing. Doesn't say when. Doubt I'll see that. \n\nAlso, be careful of the sales tactics at this store. When I originally went in to purchase two phones and two lines, the salesperson said she threw in a Blue-tooth headpiece. Well, when I got home she did; however, I was charged the full price of $19.95. It worked for a few days then quit charging. I don't have the receipt so can't really do much about that. \n\nTo sum it up, save the grief of having to deal with their horrible  customer service and go ELSEWHERE.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SKaZKF6SqA_rkDv3i0W9dw"}

It wasn't bad, mind you... but, for something that won \"Best in LV\" two years in a row, I expected a LOT better.\n\nFirst off, just to start with something good, the place is HEAVY with the smell of smoked meats... always a good thing.  Also, they offer 2 decent BBQ sauces, a mild and a hot.  The hot really wasn't that spicy, but it had a decent enough flavor.\n\nWe started with the BBQ wings, which were average.  As I said, the sauce is pretty decent, so these were as good as expected.\n\nFor the entree, my date and myself had the \"2-meat\" meals.  I had the Andouille and Pulled Pork.  The Andouille... really wasn't.  It was more of a polish sausage.  Not that I'm complaining, it's just that it wasn't Andouille.  The pulled pork was kinda dry, and I needed to sauce the crap out of it.  With that, were the 2 sides of Mac and Cheese, and Fried Okra.  The Okra needed salt, and the mac and cheese... well...  OK, I originally come from the south, and I've had my share of Mac and Cheese.  Buzz BBQ puts (what I'm guessing is) oregano in their mac and cheese.  Something I have never had before, and although it wasn't terrible... it certainly didn't help the dish either.\n\nMy date had the chicken, and catfish.  She liked the oversized portion of catfish, and said the chicken was all smoke, and no other flavor.  She also had Okra, and the BBQ beans as her sides.  Aside from the lack of salt on the Okra, she said the BBQ beans were good.  She also had the Peach Cobbler, in which she said \"I've had better.\"\n\nOverall, the price wasn't terrible, for some reason BBQ places seem to charge more than you are expecting anyway.  As far as \"Best in Las Vegas\" goes?  I'll say although I don't agree on their pricing (WAY too much IMO,) TC's Rib Crib (who won \"Best in Las Vegas\" in 2007) has better food.\n\nOverall, I didn't hate the place... I just probably won't go back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8S31wjHVC1Rx71ooEcTRTQ"}

Went in today, nail technician named Jim, Vietnamese guy, just did a horrible job with pedicure. I explained prior to starting my concerns and I had to ask several times - \"could you please take this out... Something here hurts... Not ingrown but skin. He then says too deep. My profession will not allow me to go deeper. I didn't ask to go deep just clean out as much cuticles as he can... He then kept asking, after making some nipper movements - ok now? \nI came there expecting a NAIL PROFESSIONAL knows what they're doing. I am sure that NOT all technicians there provide the same service as he does. That is not fair to them. This review is specifically for Jim ONLY. \nI still paid $40 for a deluxe service that WASN'T anywhere close to DELUXE. As soon as I left the nail place, I called to speak to a manager.. and the receptionist ALYSSA spoke with me and she agreed that I didn't get all what deluxe pedicure covers. She couldn't do anything. YES - there was a scrub, lotion, callus remover but the service that should've come with it was something JIM didn't do well. \nI could go on and on. I'll just warn you to not get your pedi by the same guy that I have to deal with. \n\nI left with no polish. I refuse to have JIM continue. I can't stand the next half hour of him asking me -- is this ok? If he knows what he is doing then he should be confident of the service he provides... That he is professionally trained to do. \n\nI just remembered that he said - \"I'LL GIVE YOU A LONGER MASSAGE SONYOU WON'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT TODAY.\"\n\nI couldn't wait to get out of there! Ugh! \n\n\nMy wishful hope is to get my money back OR have them do it right but I'll see if the manager Linda will give me a call.", "type": "review", "business_id": "wkKT3rCPoRGuqa0rVjXiVA"}

A quesadilla may not have eggs in it, but meat and cheese and all that good stuff sounds close enough to breakfast for me.  We noticed this small La Salsa situated down the end of a long, nondescript corridor, and figured it was the best that we were going to do before we went at each other's throats out of starvation.\n\nSat down, service was friendly.  This was by far the nicest La Salsa into which I've ever ventured... it was a proper sit-down restaurant.  Of course, the prices were higher to reflect this, but it was still a relative bargain for a restaurant on the strip.\n\nThe girl went for enchiladas, and I opted for the chipotle quesadilla.  Didn't try the enchiladas, but the chipotla quesadilla was fine... chicken, pico de gallo, guacamole, and a chipotle sauce that wasn't the worst I've ever had.  Too much cheese on the quesadilla, which was the same feedback that the girl gave on her enchiladas.  Other than that, all of the ingredients seemed pretty fresh, and the flavors weren't terrible.\n\nI also ordered a pineapple mojito, which was pretty narsty.  It was a specialty of the house, which meant that it was premade and sitting there in a glass jar so that the pineapple flavor would infuse with the rum... tasted more like a margharita to me, or sweet and sour mix, or something... I hate sweet and sour mix.  It was overpriced too, which chapped me a bit, but hey it's Vegas.\n\nOh, and the bathroom had bugs in it... gross.\n\nAll in all, 2 stars.  The food was palatable if not enjoyable, the mojito was disgusting (but I still drank it for the alcohol content), but the service was fine.   I wouldn't go back, but it served its role in a pinch.  Oh, the one nice thing was that they did have a nice round center bar in the restaurant which had multiple televisions airing college football... a redeeming quality no doubt.  But still, I'll drop my bucks elsewhere.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zIurGzYhoKsmSxFgilVnig"}

Tasted like fish-sauce water. Grilled pork on the vermicelli dish was wafer thin and dry. And they use a lot of coloring on their meats which makes the food look less appealing. Banh xeo had nice crunch but only had a few small shrimps inside and I don't remember seeing any pork at all. Vegetable accompaniments were each lacking something authentic to the dish. I did not try any of the macarons, but we were given crepe samples which were ok. Free drink with yelp check-in if you want to try some new drinks.

So we ended up moving to another table, the whole incident was a huge inconvenience and you'd think that management would have done something to make up for the horrible experience that we encountered during our first visit to their restaurant.\n\nI honestly never complain unless it's warranted, but this was flat out piss poor customer service.  When something goes wrong with your customer especially something like this, you make it right.  Comp the meal, offer free meal tickets so that your customers don 't want walk away unhappy.  Make it right!!! especially when you know you're in the wrong.  Your customers first impression can be a lasting impression.  If you have an opportunity to make it right, do so and then all is well.  \n\nAgain, it was my first  time visiting the resort and I actually liked the hotel, but this restaurant was horrible and management clearly doesn't know anything about customer service.

Hook!  We have been there at least a dozen times and thoroughly enjoyed the food...until tonight.\n\nWe were seated promptly; we had reservations.

It came promptly, along with our bread and our cocktails. Wow...good service?  I would like to have enjoyed at least a sip of my drink first! Our waiter pressed us for our entree order and we said we hadn't decided yet...he looked annoyed, left, but then circled like a vulture for the next 20 minutes.

I inquired if the chef might consider making the carbonara, even though it was not scheduled for that night and was immediately told 'no', never offering to check, so I settled on the fusilli with pesto. (For those of you who cook, you know that carbonara is pretty much a no-brainer to make and every professional Italian kitchen would have the ingredients on hand any night.)  My husband ordered spaghetti and meatballs.  I tried his as soon as it arrived and the meatballs were decent and there were four, a generous portion.  My fusilli, however, was tasteless and boring.....no seasoning and very bland.  The pesto was dry and there seemed to be no salt on anything.  I had my husband try it, since I like things well-seasoned  but he shared my opinion. By then, I was so annoyed and just wanted the meal to end.  We didn't even take our leftovers, which for us, is unheard of.

I would rate it a zero if I could. My boyfriend & I came here for some essentials I ran out of because I love to get dolled up & had the day off. I've been in there dozens of times, but I'm normally alone & most always \"made up\", but I had the day for the first time in 3 weeks and wanted to wear sweats.\nWhen we first came in associates were kind, but stand off-ish. I like to take my time when shopping so we spent a fair amount of time in there. \nMultiple times the same 4 employees (including a manager) \"suggested\" I get help from their employees & tried ushering me over towards more populated & open parts of the store.  I've worked retail 5 years of my life I know when people are trying to use redirecting tactic to prevent consumers from stealing. Most times they didn't even say anything. They would just follow us around looking over our shoulders listening to what we were talking about. THE ENTIRE TIME!\nThe finally straw was at the counter the cashier was attempting to be kind (with that same manager looking over her shoulder). As we were finishing up the transaction the manager walked from behind the counter & walked behind us. I happened to be looking in the direction & saw her look down into my purse (open because I took my wallet out) to investigate, curious to see if I'd stolen something. \nI was so offended that after taking the few products I really needed out of the bag I turned right back around to return the extra novelty items. I didn't want to give them anymore money than necessary.\nThe girl at the counter went through the routine, \"is there anything wrong with the product..\" & I simply left it at \"no.\" I saw the same manager circling behind me & then she walked behind the counter stared at me with a very unprofessional attitude & said, \"..but you JUST bought it.\" As if I weren't there for the transaction. I replied, \"I know\" and stared right back. We finished the transaction and I left that store for the last time. I will not spend another dime there.", "type": "review", "business_id": "NC1xlLH-6If4PraDPQaHOQ"}

Yes, I know it is summer in Arizona but this was in worse shape then other course I played the same week. It was also a overall bad experience.\n\nMy friend set up the tee time on line through the Raven's page, not some 3rd party company, and it was the Raven at Verrado page. Well, when we get there the lady has no reservation for our group, and other then admitting fault, tries to blame us saying we were the one to make the mistake. It wasn't until my friend pulled it up on his email which confirmed our tee time, and also showed the $10 that was put as a deposit. Yup, they took his $10 and still showed no tee time. When he asked where the $10 when the lady stated that she had no idea.\n\nLucky for us it was a Monday so we were still able to get on because they were not that busy. The first green should have been a sign of things to come as it was about 40% grass and 60% sand. This was par for the rest of the course. All of the greens were this same very poor condition. \n\nThe third hole was the biggest bust of all though. As one of my friends was in mid swing of his drive, a grounds man took off in a gator cart right behind him. If you don't know, those gator carts are LOUD. Then he drove up to the green and turned the sprinklers on. I just about lost my mind! Between all the years of golf my friends and I have, we have never seen anything like this.\n\nI am sure this was an isolated incident because Raven's are generally very nice, and I would like to play here again. However, this was an awful experience.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Inw6wqV6Jisv_k6Nr-M0VA"}

Something's not adding up here..\n\n*note for the cook, not every dish needs black pepper, less is more sometimes! Not sure if you have tried your food lately but most of your dishes are missing something !! This is Korean Mex fusion , here's a clue, add some creamy sauce to your Mexican inspired dishes*\n\nNow .. My Background ..\nI'm from California so maybe the fusion here \njust can't beat it. Most of the dishes seemed to be missing just a little something... I was not impressed. We came here from Utah after hiking all day. Our group of 7 was hungry and ready to chow down.\n\nI'll start with the best and go down the list. Here is what we ordered.\n\nKim chi fried rice 5/5\nI'm a sucker for kim chi fried rice, some people like it, some don't. Me, I love a good kim chi fried rice. This dish packs a moist and flavorful punch in every bite. This is a must order!\n\nBulgogi cheese steak 4/5\nDocked one star because you need to put sauce on each bite to taste the fusion. The \"bulgogi\" was not very seasoned. In general it was a good sandwich for you cheesesteak lovers.\n\nBulgogi chimichanga 3/5\nHey, where's the meat? Totally just a few scraps in my chimichanga  ? This also needed much sauce with each bite... And why was there black pepper poured all over the top? There is never black pepper on chimichangas or bulgogi!! Why did you put it ? It totally threw off the taste!!\n\nKimchi side dish 2/5\nHmmm, flavor was good, but $3 for kimchi.. And it's served warm and mushy.. Wttthhhhheck?? This should be cold and only served cold..\n\nSpicy pork fusion nachos 2/5\nOh Koja kitchen, you've ruined me for eveyone else. There was no white sauce on these nachos, and this dish too was missing a certain something .. At least there was no black pepper on this one. Also just a few crumbs of meat accompanied this dish.\n\nWonton 1/5\nDon't order it. Wonton skins soft and soggy, meat filling one dimensional, dry and lacking flavor. Again, heavy handed chef with black pepper overload in the soup but forgot to season the meat in the wonton.\n\nBulgogi plate 1/5\nDry, super plain and bland presentation. Doesn't look Korean/Mexican/Chinese/American ... Don't order this here !!!\n\nBurrito 1/5  I didn't try it but it looked dry and standard.. Very plain..., I asked my friend who ate it and one word. \"Meh\" Nothing special here to try folks!\n\nI dropped my fork and our waitress heard ,( probably due to the empty restaurant and the cling of my fork falling broke the sound of the crickets in the background ) she quickly came over and replaced it right away. Although I rated this 5/5 service, I suppose she earned the 20% gratuity we were never informed of.. \n\nOverall, I won't be back. I was wondering how my experience food wise can differ so much from other yelpers. Apparently, another yelper pointed out a change of ownership. That would explain it.\n\nThe restaurant was empty during dinnertime, new ownership, you should probably be reading these reviews and stepping up your game.. \n\nBtw most people like meat.. And with the little customers your have trickling in now a days, you should probably give people more meat to make them happier with your sub par food, unoriginal menu and dull flavors\n\nNote for hungry yelpers, my ballers on a budget.  If you are hungry and need a cheap bite off the strip, you don't need to come out here! Check out all the Asian restaurants off spring mountain. It's a 2-5 min drive from the strip and you can find anything you want there.", "type": "review", "business_id": "H_SuH7uLiYahDMbNBB9kog"}

I called the front desk to complain that I specifically asked for a non smoking room and there was an obvious smoke odor. She told me no problem will send someone to spray room to purify smell. That took 1 1/2 hours for someone to do that who was spraying for 5 seconds then leaves. It did help but we could still smell faint odors of smoke.

Just bring me towels and toiletries...and someone actually came by in 10 minutes. What upsets me the most is that no one showed any care or concern. .they were just so matter of fact.

Instead of a foot stool, there were two small stools for each individual foot, which are lifted by the nail technicians leg.

No kids channels and no movie channels. again even cheaper hotels offer this. I'm not sure if this is a new thing with hotels converting to resorts but this place is no resort. The tub would clog during a shower and within minutes your standing in about inch and half of water. After 5 minutes it would start to backfill with some nasty dirty water. Forcing us to take extremely fast showers. Then it would take 15 minutes to drain. Also the tub was never cleaned while we where there. Only the towels and trash where changed daily. \nIf you have kids I would advise staying somewhere more kid friendly. We reserved a crib when booking. called to confirm one before coming into town. Asked for it when we arrived and checked in and was told it will be delivered to the room shortly. It never showed. I called the front desk and was advised they didn't have any. Finally got one the next morning after I called first thing. \nThe pool area is small giving the size of the hotel. If you don't get out there early your not getting a spot. Then the bar is also expensive. $7 for a can of beer? even more for a mixed drink. The restaurants are godly expensive. The coffee shop was $50 for some coffee and pastries. Even Starbucks itself would have been cheaper. We had dinner the first night at the buffet. 3 adults and 2 kids came to over $150!!

If it was for our server darlene being just the greatest women ever I wouldn't have gone twice. I would recommend eating outside of the hotel. \n You can tell the new owners are in this for the top dollar and not a total guest experience.

I used to frequent this location years ago, and loved it!  I returned a few months ago, to get treated to an overpriced, underwhelming experience that led to both myself and my date getting food poisoning over bad mussels.  By the way, it was a first date, nothing says \"go out with this guy again\"  like being glued to your toilet the entire next day praying that you'll just die.\n\nI called them, and told them what happened (specifically stating I wasn't looking for a handout, I just wanted to let them know that their mussels had turned, and they should check their product), and the manager told me that I had to have been mistaken, and that they only keep in fresh ingredients.  They did send me a $15 gift card, which I thought was nice even though that a $15 gift card is the middle finger of gift cards, so I decided to try them once more.\n\nOK, so that was just a fluke, they gave me a gift card, time to put on my optimistic pants and try again.  So I took one of my long time friends out for lunch.\n\nWe walked in, and we were given the new option to sit in the \"Wine Bar\".  \n\nOOOooo, color me intrigued.  \n\nSo they took us outside, up some stairs, and into what I'm guessing was a middle aged Persian's studio apartment above a garage that they converted into a dining room.  We then waited for service for an inhuman amount of time before we were given waters.  I ordered a dry red wine, and my friend ordered a cocktail.  We waited, and eventually got those, and they were actually very nice.  \n\nWe ordered mussels again (cringe) and the meat and cheese plate.  First thing I knew was iffy was the meat and cheese plate.  They replaced the normal wooden board, and replaced it with a plate.  A white, boring, incredibly small plate.  On top of it all, it was more of a plate of lunch meat than a charcuterie!  Blah.  The mussels were good though, and my bowels remained intact, though we asked for bread when it was dropped, and had to ask for it a second time.  What a waste, the broth was actually good, but cold by the time we actually got our bread.\n\nSo I'm sorry Il Pizzaiolo, I really tried to like you, but until the quality returns, I won't be.\n\nTL;DR  Don't go here, there are a ton of cheaper, better Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh", "type": "review", "business_id": "6-rJjW6ITl5o_FliiNgZRA"}

Laney came over and said she'd refund half, but later agreed to refund me for both my meal and my guest's meal, which was as cold and stale as mine. When she came back, Laney presented me with a new receipt for $4, citing that there was nothing wrong with the sodas we ordered. While that was true, I explained I believed that was horribly petty since my guest had drunk none of his soda and I had so little of mine -- and the point of the drinks were to enjoy them with our meals. The man, whom I assume to be Laney's brother, came over and was very apologetic, refunded all of my money and offered to cook us fresh food  free of charge to learn how good his fresh cooking was (We declined.), but he didn't seem to think there was a problem with having cold and stale food on the buffet line. \n\nLong story short, I think that China Farm uses quality ingredients and may very well produce good food when cooked to order, but don't count on getting an edible meal at the buffet.

Wasn't impressed by their Sunday brunch. Didn't like the presentation of the buffet. It was in a small area and felt kind of cramped. The salad was made with iceberg lettuce and didn't look appetizing. My friends ordered orange juice and each glass was filled to the brim with large pieces of ice, which means that they really just had maybe 1/2 a glass of orange juice. In all, it's really nothing special, just very basic. It was my first time eating at Harris Grill.

The pictures they show are of their OWN OFFICE QUARTERS!  The apartments themselves were built in the 60s or 70s and look NOTHING like that.  The counters are chipped, there are huge holes where the sink plumbing goes into the wall, through which come bugs and awfulness, the carpets are uneven and ugly, there are giant gapped holes in those too that looking down into bug-infested between-floors, and various staples and nails stick up throughout the awful place for you to cut your feet on.  So yeah, these people are liars.  If that's not illegal, it should be, and these asshats should be strung up in public for everyone to see and cheer.\n\nThey are slum-lords and act like it.  The landlords do no repairs or renovation (see other reviewer's statement that they think a paint job is a renovation, completely true), but since the area AROUND them is slowly becoming gentrified, they think they can up the rent each year, and do.\n\nHah.  Hahahaha.  No I'm serious, they do literally NO repairs or renovation, but your rent jacks up every year like you're living somewhere fancy.\n\nOh wait, does cutting down the one nice tree count as renovation?  Then I guess they did that.\n\nAlso the people around there are scum, too.  A guy stuck a gun in my boyfriend's back when going down to get pizza once and attempted to rob him (boyfriend had emptied his pockets before going down just in case, so the thug got nothing), and that wasn't the first crime we encountered, so be wary of that.  They do have locking doors on the front of each building, but a lot of the locks don't work and most people just prop them open because there's no friggin' BUZZER OR INTERCOM to let you know if you have visitors, so you kind of have to leave it open.\n\nIf you disbelieve anything I've said, just take one drive through the parking lot.  It's completely obvious when you're there in person, and not relying on their lying photographs, that the place is a terrible ghetto.  You will lock your doors and screech out of there faster than you can say \"slum-lords\"!", "type": "review", "business_id": "W9H1gIQlZPuak7C5tLzUvg"}

There are some winners and losers on any buffet but I felt like this one had a lot of losers.  \n\nGoing around the loop, you first see soup and smoked fish (scallops, salmon, mussels).  These were terrible.  Whoever cooked those should be removed from the kitchen and put on maintenance duty where they'll be better suited.  There are numerous salad selections and the mozzeralla on the Caprese salad was about the same consistency as a hockey puck.  The carving area had a few nice choices but unfortunately they were all of poor quality.  The prime rib was very undercooked and full of grizzle, the pork loin was ok but overcooked, and the fresh cut bacon was cold rubber.  You could ask them to grill it up after cutting it but I think hot food is a must have from the buffet.  \n\nThe Asian selection was actually pretty good.  The shumai were good and the rest of the selections were better than average.  The seafood is right next to this which is the other somewhat bright spot (so you should probably spend your whole time in this corner).  Regarding the seafood, the shrimp were decent but the lobster claws tasted as if they'd been frozen since the Eisenhower administration.  The crab legs, while also clearly frozen since the dawn of time, were of much better quality.  I'd recommend soaking the crab meat in drawn butter to rehydrate and heat it.  \n\nDesserts are abundant and, again, hit or miss.  The mini creme brulee was basically a war crime while the mini tiramisu was delicious.  For drinks, the included champagne is cheap but does the trick.  \n\nSome to like...so much to dislike.  A decent brunch but if you're going to spend about $40/pp after tip you might as well splurge and go somewhere high end like the Wrigley Mansion.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Vn8qcaX64fkl8vByCsSvIg"}

The rooms are disgusting and the management is terrible.  The hotel is run down and has no customer service.  We checked in on the 22nd of December.  Upon entering the room, I was immediately turned off.  The carpet was old, torn and has rust stains.  The bathroom cabinet had peeling paint and was dirty.  The bathtub had a screw sticking out of it that could have been a safety issue had I allowed my child to go anywhere near the tub (I didn't notice that until the morning).  We arrived late, ran out to dinner and show and came back to the room to sleep.  The beds and pillows are awful.  We described them as low rent motel quality.  That night the television was pixellating and we couldn't even wind down to tv.  The next morning I called the front desk to let them know that I was going to move hotels.  It wasn't until I went down there and spoke with Leslie (a manager) that they told me they were going to take that room out of circulation and upgrade us into another room.  The upgrade was also not wonderful.  The beds were slightly better, the pillows still sucked.  On the morning of the 24th, I noticed that the air vent in this new 'upgraded' room was fully clogged (that explained my sneezing and respiratory issues almost immediately upon checking into the room.  I spoke with manager M. Eric Holmes, who told me he would send maintenance up to fix the issue.  Housekeeping came hours later and stated she couldn't do anything to fix it and she would send maintenance.  When we returned from dinner that night it had still not been taken care of.  The manager was rude, arrogant and exacerbated an already tense situation with his complete and utter lack of professionalism.  We ended up leaving the hotel and checked into a much nicer property.  Trust me when I tell you that Motel 6 would be a step up.  In addition,  we had Christmas Eve dinner at the pricey Eiffel Tower restaurant which had the audacity to charge $46 for a piece of fish (a la carte) and then serve it cold.

REALLY?!? \n\n   So we finally get checked in at 3:45 and head over to our room which was extremely spacious and nice and cool since the AC was at 75 degrees (I immediately cranked it down to its low end - 60 degrees) and threw our luggage in the closet. I went to shower and the only light over the tub is a heat light! Needless to say I opted to shave my legs in the dark. \n\n   On our second day there I realized there looked to be poop smeared on the back of our bathroom door. It wasn't a huge streak, nor was it blatantly obvious, or I think I would have noticed it immediately, however, I'm not sure what else would be on the bottom part of the back of a bathroom door that is brown. \n\n   The room was cleaned every day and we even got fresh towels, even though I kept folding ours and leaving them on the rack. We got twp bottles  of water every day which was nice. My biggest complaint: we're paying a $15 per day per room \"resort\" fee and they can't even put blackout curtains on the door in the bedroom. We had a nice jacuzzi out back, but it is now AZ state law that they can not have them filled and must keep the door that leads out to it locked because some girl drowned a few years back... So the locked door has blinds on it, but it is still bright as noon in there right after sunrise. Blackout curtains in the living room and on the windows in the bedroom, but NOT on the door?

The first time we dined here, we felt like the fish and chips were close to authentic. My boyfriend is British so he is a tough sell when it comes to good fish and chips.\n\nWe continued to frequent English's and enjoyed the food (other than the chips coming out consistently over cooked). Sometimes we had bad service and sometimes we had food that wasn't so great. Just when we started feeling like we should stop eating here, they'd be on point with both. Well, we finally had enough of crappy service and mediocre food as of our last visit two visits.\n\nTerrible service and disgusting dessert the second to last time we ate here. Server kept forgetting our drinks, rang them up incorrectly and wasn't attentive. Do not order the arctic roll! It tasted old and freezer burned. \n\nThe last time we were there our fish wasn't cooked properly. We called a waiter (our waiter was out of sight) to ask if the salmon was supposed to be a dark pink in the middle and he said he would ask. He went inside the kitchen then came out stating that the chef cooked it medium well and that's how it is traditionally served. We then proceeded to show him the variance in color between the end (more orange in color) and the middle (more pink in color). He was about to go into the kitchen and ask again so we asked him if he wanted to take the fish to show the chef, he did. He came back out with the partially eaten plate, placed it on the table and said it was undercooked. He asked if we wanted a new one. We asked for a new one because from what we did eat, the salmon was tasty. He was going to leave the undercooked fish on our table so we asked him to take it. While we waited for a new salmon fish and chips, our waiter stopped by our table to feed us more excuses and support the original idea of \"medium well\" fish. In their defense, the chips were cooked perfectly. I proceeded to eat my cod which was slightly cold in the center because I didn't want to cause an even bigger scene. My boyfriend watched me eat and I him once his food came out. It was cooked well the 2nd time but the chips were overcooked. Throughout the whole experience, NOT ONE APOLOGY FROM ANYONE. No offers to comp anything.\n\nHaving worked in the food industry for a few years, I'm disappointed and a bit angered by their lack of professionalism.

Unfortunately for us, this was pretty much the worst dining experience we've had in a long time and left us super upset (hopefully going to actual Paris will be MUCH better).\n\nLet me start off by saying that I understand a busy restaurant can be overwhelming to some, and it did seem like Petite Maison was understaffed on Saturday, however I don't think it excuses everything.  First off, the hostess seemed flustered and upset right when we walked up to the hostess stand.  She said the computer wasn't working and to give her a minute.  Once we were sat, she asked us what kind of water we wanted and left to get it (or so we thought).  Our reservation was for 7:15 and we arrived a few minutes early, so we were sat around 7:15 - it wasn't until 7:20 that our waiter finally greeted us (for the first time).  Also, we didn't get water until 7:25 and that was after ordering our meal, getting other drinks, and asking twice for water.  The food did come fast, maybe too fast, considering we got both our appetizer (foie gras) and entree (steak frittes) at the same time.  The foie gras was very tiny compared with pictures I saw posted on yelp.  It tasted good, but I wasn't in love with the accompanying items.  The steak was RARE when we got it.  We knew we would be sending it back - the problem was the waiter never even asked us how we wanted it cooked.  We ate some of the fries while waiting for our waiter to stop by and ask us how things were, so we could send it back, but it took 10 minutes for him to check with us and take it back.  It took another 10 for the steak to come back, and this time it was pretty much med-well (not med like we asked).  In addition, the fries and steak were SOOOOO salty.  I cannot emphasize this enough.  We left with so much salt in our systems it was unbelievable.\n\nSo, between the lack of service and just plain bad food, I don't think I will be returning to Petite Maison.  In fact, the only way I would go back is if they gave me back my $60 for this meal.  The waiter was unbelievably unfriendly.  He had zero personality and didn't care that we were having a bad experience.  I really try to look past a lot of things, but this meal was just plain bad from start to finish.", "type": "review", "business_id": "no_FXjscklz1SEzM_XnVgw"}

After checking in at the host stand it took another 15 minutes before out table was ready??....and it was NOT busy at this stage and as above one of the reasons we made the later booking. After being seated it was at least another 10 minutes before anyone came to attend to us other than getting served ice water???....the waitress finally came to the table and gave us the menus and told us of the specials....took our cocktail orders and was off.....another 10 minutes passed and finally we were served 1 small bread basket with one small dish of butter....for 5 people??....still no cocktails but we placed an appetizer order and also our entree order as well as we were really hungry at this point.....well another 10 minutes passed and still no cocktails or appetizers.....we had devoured the small bread basket long ago so we asked another different waiter if we could get another basket and it seemed like we were asking for something way out of line???.....finally our waitress came back to our table (after we observed her across the room at another table chatting for at least 10 minutes) and asked about our cocktails which by now had been ordered about 20 minutes ago.....5 minutes later the cocktails arrived and 5 minutes after that the appetizers arrived....had oysters rockefeller which were cold and just very bland in general. Approximately another 15 minutes later our entrees arrived and as 3 in our group had ordered steaks we found that all 3 were NOT at anywhere near the requested level of temperature other than the one filet that had been requested as medium well and since it was butterflied it had been cooked to a piece of shoe leather!!!....the other 2 were to be medium and were basically what anyone would call very rare to rare at best....with the length of time it had taken just to get served we were not about to try and send anything back....the one Chilean Sea Bass entree was very good....the salmon entree was again cold, bland and just not what one would expect from a establishment with the reputation the Monterey Bay Fish Grotto was supposed to have....oh and the $12 tricolor roasted potatoes were also cold, bland and tasteless!!.....we ate what we could and left after a $400 bill with significant disappointment!!.....I know some will say why did you go to the \"Fish Grotto\" and order steaks but thats what our group chose and if it is on the menu and at the prices charged they also should be nothing short of excellent which they were NOT....having dined all over the Pittsburgh area for the last 35 years I can assure diners who are looking for a great dining experience that there are FAR BETTER choices than the MBFG.....unless you want to spend $80 per person (with NO wine) just for the chance of having a table with the great view I highly suggest you look elsewhere even on Mt Washington....as per the title simply not even close to \"The Standard\" expected and deserved.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9oImwXLAn-DFppBrfbmkLg"}

They are multiple \"stores\" under one roof, often competing with each other in an effort to be the best each month. It's a life of pressure behind the scenes and I know that. That said, Brent Berge's Riverview Toyota has always done right by me whether with service or a new car purchase. \n\nI like to tell a joke as follows: \"How do you know if you've been reamed on a car deal? Do you own a car?\" The simple fact is that any dealer is a business which is there to make money. They don't let product off the lot unless they are making money on it. I get that too. Whether a dealer is fair, decent and honest is what sets them apart and in my experience, Riverview Toyota stands apart from the crowd in these areas. \n\nI have been a customer of service both warranty and paid and have been treated fairly and repairs have been handled efficiently. I have always felt that they respected me and my property. \n\nAs a two time new car customer I feel I have received good treatment. This dealership changed owners from Larry Miller (when I bought my first car) to Brent Berge and there is a difference in the way the place \"feels\" after that change. It's more relaxed, friendlier and just better all around. It's not the sort of place a person dreads entering, as some can be. \n\nIn my most recent purchase, I never felt pressured. To the contrary, I felt as if they were reading my mind. That was a little eerie at first until it hit me that this is their job. It's their job to match the customer with the right car and the right deal and they made this a simple, fluid process and helped me feel good and confident about doing business there. Fleet sales was great. That's the no-nonsense end of any car dealer and I like that but what was unique was they brought in a salesman who is presumably being compensated, to show me all of the car's systems, take care of the paperwork and see to my general satisfaction. So it wasn't a \"Here, out the door\" fleet deal at all. They took time to help me get to know a very different new car and seemed to know intuitively where I would have some questions. There was never any rush to get me out and on the road. They took time. \n\nThe only criticism I have is one that is universal for me. The money guy who handles the final paperwork and payment/financing, etc. makes a brick look exciting. It goes with the job because every dealer has one of these. They're robots who march through forms and they all have the personality of gravel. I'd like to see that same friendly ambiance extend into that final office as well, but to his credit, he was honest and efficient. \n\nI like this dealership. I know no dealership can please everybody 100% but I feel they have always gone out of their way to make me happy and to earn my business.

First I just went for dinner.  We ordered a deep dish pizza for 3 of us to share.  We were told it takes about 45 min to cook?  Whatever, ordered anyways.  About 45 min later, a manager comes over and tells us he gave our pizza to another table by mistake.  He says he already put another pizza in and it would be ready in a few min.   About 10 min later he comes back with a pizza, a thin pizza.  We thought he was joking at first.  However, we weren't about to wait for another pizza so we ate it and left hungry, luckily the bill was comped though.\n\nThe next time was with a group of 15 people.  They DON\"T TAKE RESERVATIONS!!???  We were told to send someone from the party an hour ahead to hold a table, like saving seats at a movie theater? So me and another person arrive an hour before the time everyone else was coming.  3pm on a weekday.  The place was nearly empty however they still seemed uneasy about seating us, and tried to split our party into several tables.  We finally get things sorted out with the hostess and decide to hang at the bar.  Since we knew the pizzas take 45 min to an hour to cook, we decide to pre-order some for the table.  The bartender has to check with the manager, and we get a hard no, with no explanation.  I happen to see one of the managers hanging by the bar and ask him about it.  He tells me they have a catering thing and the kitchen is backed up (like I care).  We don't do preorders, it's our policy. We bring up the reservations. It's our policy.  So we've run into several of your policies that have inconvenienced your customer, just to make it easier for you!  A different manager comes over and asks us what is going on, we explain how we wanted to preorder.  He says that's fine. Guess the kitchen wasn't so backed up after all?  He then tells us that next time we have a big party we should cater.  I even had to clarify if 15 was that big of a party? Also, that he was encouraging us to cater, rather than visit the restaurant.  So we place our order and keep sitting at the bar until 4pm.  I then go to the hostess to get our table, just as the rest of our party starts to filter in. Surprise!  She gave our table away!  Luckily another hostess who seemed to be the only intelligent one in there made arrangements to push some tables together.  Even though we were just told that none of the tables moved.  We get seated and the rest of the evening goes smooth.  Me as well as everyone in our party will not be returning.  On both occasions the staff seemed to only care about themselves, and made little effort to accommodate us. Unfortunate because the food isn't bad.\n\nAnd for anyone wondering, I have lived in Cave Creek my entire life.", "type": "review", "business_id": "10RoUv7N_K3amPyJ3Ao2YQ"}

I told the guy working the dough (and I've seen more than once them picking something out of it which isn't at all appetizing to watch - what are you picking out?!) at the beginning of the counter that we wanted a margherita with toppings. He said, \"okay,\" and I moved down the counter to where the toppings are. It always seems to take FOREVER for these guys to get the dough perfectly shaped. A little pat here, a little pat there... This isn't art class and your little pats are doing nothing to improve the pizza and I'm yelling, \"hurry up!\" in my head. Then I hate watching them put sauce on, because it reminds me of how little they put! It's like they are challenging themselves to how little of it they can spread around and make it look like there's something there. So I'm standing there and waiting for someone else to finish it off with breaking apart and spreading around the blob of mozzarella cheese so that they can finally take my toppings order, when suddenly all of these customers that came in AFTER me are working their way past me at the direction of the counter guys. The guy with my margherita is pointing at a guy behind me to follow him to the toppings counter. The staff behind the counter pay no attention to me. HELLO?! Do any of you behind the counter think I might be standing there for a reason?! You guys left me high and dry and I'm now just a road block for all of the customers you DID remember. I worked my way back to the beginning of the counter and told the dough guy that took my order that this ordering line system sucks and that I'm leaving. He offered no apology and said he could make my pizza right at that moment, but I left on principle. I walked through the Monte Carlo to Sbarro's and got a couple of slices of pizza without incident. \nAs far as the pizza goes, it's always soggy in the center. If you order sausage, beware of it being undercooked. My daughter loves sausage but I wouldn't let her eat the pink sausage crumbles. Their pizza is cooked in 60 seconds, which isn't long enough to safely cook pork.\nYea, I know it's Neapolitan style pizza, to be eaten with knife and fork, but I've had better and this place just doesn't do it for me.

Everything could have used more flavor. I don't think it made that much difference that we took the food home. \n\nWe ordered the Catfish, Snapper and Meatloaf dinners(which came with three sides each.)

Not only could I not find the cheese but I could find any flavor. It was not the traditional Black Mac and Cheese that is baked with cheese. Greens were ok, nothing to discuss. \n\nThe worst part was the Peach Cobbler. I was excited when I saw the Peach Cobbler picture on the website, it looked delicious and flavorful. Instead of Peach Cobbler, I received two bowls of dough with maybe two peaches. I warmed it up for 45 secs like they suggested but that did not make any difference.

Decided to just try a Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e shake.\n\nThe shake doesn't have the crunchy \"br\u00fbl\u00e9e\" pieces that Zinburger has (nor any eggy custard-like flavor), and just tastes like a plain caramel shake with a squiggle of caramel sauce on top.  It's still good, but not at the same level of Zinburger's by any means, and probably slightly below SmashBurger's Salted Caramel shake (though it's larger).  I wish they had the option to order a smaller size, as that much blended soft serve (not hand-scooped ice cream) didn't sit well with me.\n\nThe Rrstaurant is modern, clean, and definitely fits the Chipotle fast casual mold.  I would come back to try out their food, but would not come back for dessert or a treat.  It's definitely a massive improvement over the always-empty Qdoba that had this space before.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ETrtpthOGuC8q7rE17s30g"}

This location lacks staffing and I always feel rushed and belittled for asking questions.   \n\nToday I went in with myself and two kids.  Nobody in line the girl had her order pad.  I wanted a soup bread bowl.  She told me I have to order it down the line, this part is just sandwiches.  I do need a turkey sandwich.   Instead of grilled cheese can I order an adult grilled turkey?  Turkey is toasted but we can grill it.  OK great. Didn't happen.  It came out toasted nothing on it but two slices of turkey, dry, no cheese with 4 tomatoes.   Kids hate tomatoes.   I will deal with it and peel off the tomatoes. \n\nBack to the line thing, I am in the salad section.   My oldest son wanted a kids half Caesar salad.  Ok.  This is going well.  I am moving down the line.  The same girl from sandwiches now is in the soup section.   Only 2 guys behind me, no worry about a rush.  I order a soup bread bowl.  We may be out of bread bowls.  You can go back to the sandwich section and order a sandwich.   Ha this is getting humorous.   I wonder if I go back will she follow me?  Another girl comes up and says they do have bread bowls.  Clam chowder nope not there not here I wonder where it is.  I found it.  Makes you feel like they don't sell much soup.  \n\nOK ring me up.  I need a soda and cup of water for my son.  She hands me one cup.  I break the silence and apologize.  Trying to get some compassion,   told her I haven't been here in years.  Is this the water cup? No they are over there.   Forget about asking for silverware.   She is too disengaged.   I won't even bother I will search down silverware.  I still can't leave just yet.  This kids salad says something about yogurt and a cookie.   Oh yea, I forgot, I will get.  The sandwich guy comes over.  I am the only one while the other two behind me still reading the menu.  My son has #48 on the table.  He says he really needs the number back.  Let me move out of this line get the number while sandwich/soup/cashier is looking for a kids yogurt. I hope my youngest doesn't pull down the tray while I retrieve #48.  In the whole place only one other table is in use.  It is not busy and his look felt like it was urgent I get that number back.  \n\nFinally to a table.  I'm in a good mood.  This whole order thing seemed comical.  Just a tiny bit of soup in this bread bowl.  Not much to eat there.  My oldest son had his salad.  He liked.   My younger son isn't having anything to do with a dry turkey sandwich.   I ordered it off the adult menu because I thought there might be something more to it.  Nope.\n\nLet's go.  No rush to come back.  \n\nIn the back of my mind I recall my niece who worked there for a summer job in 2013.  She hadn't got her food handling card.  She told me only one person had it and the manager said there was no rush.  I hope that's not the current case.  \n\nIt's too bad.  It could be a nice place.", "type": "review", "business_id": "af7ZkF4r4ywWQF-QTXvsCA"}

Let me start by saying that, while not native Southerners, the boyfriend and I spent the last several years living in Memphis, one of the BBQ capitals of the nation.  They take BBQ VERY seriously in Memphis, and it is everywhere.  After years of living around the corner from some of the best BBQ in town, we have been absolutely appalled at what passes for BBQ up here, and Brickhouse was Exhibit A.\n\nLet me set the stage -- it was a hot Sunday afternoon, around 2pm.  Not a busy time; in fact, the beautiful, multi-floor restaurant was practically deserted.  Lured by the promise of a rooftop patio, we schlepped up the stairs, only to discover that, oddly enough, there were no umbrellas.  Those few brave patrons up there were baking in the sun, and not wishing to freeze in the air conditioning inside, we joined them...after I ran back downstairs, and up again, for sunscreen and a hat from the car.\n\nCraving something cold and alcoholic at this point, but not being a beer drinker, I asked our waitress to tell me about the whopping 2 hard ciders on the menu (1 apple, 1 pear).  She mumbled something about not really knowing anything about them and settled for bringing me tasting portions from the bar.  Ok, fine.  I settled on the pear, and we ordered food.\n\nOur fried duck wings eventually came out, and they were a disappointment.  If I hadn't known they were duck, I never would have guessed, and the overly sweet sauce they were served with didn't add anything.  And then.  And then.  Halfway through our appetizer, the waitress appeared with our entrees.  My pet peeve.  \n\nRather than send them back, and risk having them sit under a warming lamp in the kitchen, we made room on the table and dug in.  My pulled pork was not spectacular, and I didn't like any of the 3 sauces on the table -- all of them seemed to have a great deal of black pepper in them, and were somehow not quite an appealing consistency.  The boyfriend's ribs were a major disappointment, clearly having been braised or otherwise cooked without benefit of a smoker, which is the whole point of BBQ (he actually commented on entering the restaurant that he didn't smell their smoker, which is a bad sign -- no smoker means no true BBQ).  \n\nHis green beans, described as spicy, were not at all, and the final straw for me was discovering that my mac 'n cheese was cold.  Cold enough that I suspected that it had been the first thing put on the plate waaaay downstairs in the kitchen, waited for the rest of my food, and, by the time it made it up several flights to me, had died a sad, quiet death.  When I pointed this out to the waitress she brought me a fresh portion (which was actually hot), but may I remind you that the restaurant was practically empty?  And who serves cold mac 'n cheese??\n\nAt this point, having been roasting in the sun for an hour and been served a poor excuse for BBQ, we paid the $60 bill and left.  Asked on the way out how it was, I commented on the lack of umbrellas on the patio and was given a lame excuse about how they were replacing the worn-out ones.  Uh, could you keep the old ones til the new ones came?  So your patrons don't die out there?\n\nSo if this is \"the best BBQ in Madison,\" that is a very sad statement.  If you don't know what BBQ is, you might like Brickhouse, but please, stay away.  Far away.", "type": "review", "business_id": "JdIDnJocVGw3qPQt-TUCzg"}

The ER is another story completely;they have a great new Trauma Center, so I think if you're in an accident or get shot, this is a good place to go. But when emergent services for non-trauma are required, they are underwhelming. I experienced that first-hand when my mother had to be admitted through the ER--getting them to understand that she was in terrible pain and needed to be examined promptly was a chore. When she began to choke and regurgitate the liquid they gave her to drink, I had to tell the nurse who was standing at bedside watching passively, \"DO something! Help her!\" It was bizarre. \n\nAs for myself, I hadn't gone to the ER for about 30 years, but today, exhausted after over a week of increasingly worse asthma, coughing, lack of sleep, I wanted to avoid a 2:00 a.m. 911 call, I went to the ER, thinking a breathing treatment might help.Their automated vital sign equipment was malfunctioning and they said they couldn't find a stethoscope or manual BP cuff.I asked for, but wasn't given a copy of the Patient Information sheet they had me sign. I was left to wait in their nearly-empty waiting room for over an hour and a half without any contact from hospital personnel, coughing and wheezing like a steam engine the whole time.\n\nMy suggestion would be, if you need attention in their ER,hit a lamp post first in your car and complain of neck pain. That way, you will be a trauma patient, and quite possibly, you will also be able to get any needed emergent medical care for your other condition(s) while you have their interest.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Aq6lSh0dfAYMsLoJf17BJQ"}

I dropped off three prescriptions yesterday, around 2:30pm. One of these prescriptions was an antibiotic that needs to be started the following morning. After 20 minutes of the pharmacy tech  attempting to place my prescription order and properly enter my insurance information, I was informed that I would be able to pick up all of my prescriptions at 6:30pm that night, as they were busy. I received a phone call around 6:10pm from a tech named Keionne, informing me that the antibiotic was not available, and would not be available until 3:30pm the following afternoon. I was also informed that I would have to call other locations to see if they held this medication, as she would not do it for me. She told me that my other prescriptions were ready for pick-up. I arrived at the pharmacy to find an extremely long line at both the drive-thru pick-up window and the internal pick-up window. I waited 30 minutes in line, and when I finally arrived to the front, I was informed by another tech that I would need to stand to the side and wait another 5-10 minutes for my prescription to be ready. 10 minutes go by, and he calls me back to the counter. At this time, I notice that he is only holding one prescription. I informed him that I should be picking up two prescriptions at this time, as they did not have the third available. He then informed me that one of the two prescriptions that I was supposed to be picking up was not going to be available until the following afternoon. I then asked him what the issue was, which prompted Keionne to walk over. She asked me what the issue was, and as I began to explain the situation, she interrupted me and began telling me that I could not be helped by her if I was going to be irate. I informed her that I was not in fact being irate, which resulted in her telling me to stop yelling. At this time, I was not yelling, and I informed her that I was not yelling. She then walked away and said, \"Whatever, I'm not dealing with this.\" At this time, I told her to let me speak to her supervisor. She continued to walk away, and the tech completed my transaction and informed me that I could wait at the consultation window to speak to the pharmacist about the issue. I stood at this desk for an additional 5 minutes, until the tech walked over to let the pharmacist know that I was waiting. She walked over to me, and with the same attitude as Keionne asked me what the issue was. I informed her of everything from beginning to end. She then said, \"What do you want me to do?\" I told her that I want what I am promised, which is my prescriptions. She then used the excuse that they are busy, to which my response was that it is not my problem if they are busy or not. She then walked away, and I told her to give me back the prescription scripts so that I could take them somewhere else. I am utterly disgusted with both the lack of customer service and the lack of ability to function as a pharmacy from CVS. Every person within this pharmacy needs to be taught the art of professionalism; I will NEVER use this or any other CVS location for anything whatsoever again, and I will encourage everyone that I know to do the same.", "type": "review", "business_id": "EYQv8VjWFetPfv2jjsjd4g"}

Is it too much to hope your curtain fits your window appropriately to do its job blocking out lights?\n\nParents more interested in things beside their children would let their children use the hallways as their playground. Ice fights, yelling, screaming, running thru the hallways, banging on doors & walls...  2 calls to the front desk to complain yielded no help & the shenanigans lasted until after 4am.  \n\nTo reach the strip, you're required to go all the way thru the casino.

We were meeting some friends there, and I walked in to see if there was a wait (and if so, put our names on the list). The hostess asked if she could help; I looked around and saw a few empty tables, so said \"no thanks, I'm meeting some friends\". She asked me to repeat myself, so I did. She still didn't hear me, so I repeated myself again. She asked yet again, so this time I almost screamed \"I\"M MEETING SOME FRIENDS AND WANTED TO SEE IF WE NEEDED TO PUT OUR NAME DOWN\". She then gave me an \"eat s--t\" look for (I suppose) \"yelling\" at her. If it wasn't so loud, I wouldn't need to say it four times.\n\nOur waiter was super-friendly, but almost comically incompetent. He went around the table asking everyone for their drink orders. He told a joke to someone, then walked off without asking if I wanted anything. He walked by several times, oblivious to me trying to get his attention. He brought out the beers for the rest of the table, but never looked once in my direction. So I had to get up, walk to the bar and order the beer myself. I don't believe he ever even asked if it we wanted another round, either. So I guess you're only allowed one beer per meal at Krazy Fish. The old man would later bring our checks as five different checks (oh, I guess he COULD see me when it was time to pay the bill!). We were two couples and a friend; I guess he could have simply ASKED how wanted them separated, but no.\n\nOK, so the service sucks... but how's the food? I got the fried shrimp tacos. They were tasty, save for the \"pink gold salsa\", which the menu describes as \"yogurt, honey, chipotle chilis and lime\". To me it tasted like yogurt, corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup, cane sugar juice, liquid glucose and hot fudge sauce. Yes, it was overwhelmingly sweet, like a shrimp taco liberally doused in liquid cotton candy. It was gross. The mac and cheese, supposedly some of the best in the city, was OK. Perhaps I've heard too much hype, but I can make significantly better mac and cheese at home myself.\n\nI've been back a couple of times, and the experience was slightly better service wise, but I think this is the most overrated food in Charlotte.", "type": "review", "business_id": "gWZt5lnRQPbTwXRi9Ik6Tw"}

But the only reason I ended up with a boba drink is that Sala doesn't have any beer or wine on their menu, and I was really in the mood for a Tsingtao.\n\n I'm not sure what the other reviewers ordered that was so spectacular to earn 4 and 5 star ratings.  My husband and I are vegetarians, so we're a bit more limited than the average omnivore.  We have a couple of standby Thai favorites, pad see ew and yellow curry with tofu, which makes it easy to compare dishes with the best Thai places back in Los Angeles where we live.  For those of you who love the smoky flavor of a great pad see ew, you will be very disappointed at Sala.  That's the best part of pad see ew and what gives it character.  Otherwise, it's basically noodles and veggies, which is what we got....except that they were very salty.  They were nicely cooked and well presented, the dish just didn't taste, well, very good.  \n\nThe yellow curry was also prepared well, meaning that the veggies were cooked to the right texture, but the coconut milk base and curry didn't shine through because the dish was salty.  \n\nI'm disappointed that we had a mediocre meal at a place that got such high marks.  This review is just to catch the eye of an unsuspecting diner who might see the flashy overall rating and assume that Sala is a great choice for a delicious Thai meal.", "type": "review", "business_id": "dvQxsFICv2HFMmQX8yI55w"}

He said they weren't going to sell that brand of boots anymore because of complaints which let me know he was aware of issues with these boots. He told me to leave them there and he would take them to the factory where they were made so they can be refinished. Two weeks later I picked them up and they looked fine. I wore them to a party and noticed the paint falling off and revealing the neutral color underneath. So I called the owner and told him I was coming in to show them to him. When I got there he wasn't there so I explained to the cashier the situation. My money didn't change color when I paid for this merchandise so it was there responsibility to own up to the situation and make this right. I didn't get any where with the cashier so I ended up going to a shoe repair store on central and southern which did a good job and I haven't had a problem with the color ever since. How can a little shop next to ranch market do what a  factory couldn't? I will say that I have purchased four pairs of alligator boots, two pitiado belts one was 700 the other was 800, several hats worth hundreds of dollars and had no issues with those.

Then a few years ago they moved to Arizona and at a location not far from where I live in Peoria. The attraction for me was the ability to get a burger wrapped in lettuce. (Protein Style) If you know the key words you can get your burger cooked many ways that are not published on the menu. I could never quite understand the crowd of people coming there to eat. Lined up out the door and a line of cars around the place with someone out side taking orders. It is just a hamburger nothing exceptional. They do have good fries. Better than most. \nToday I had spent 3 hours installing cabinet doors at my in-laws house. Was not supposed to take this much time but it seems to go that way at times. Well I worked way past lunch and was hungry. In & Out was on the way home. Really should of driven a couple of miles out of the way and gone to Rocket Burger. \nAny way I got what I always get a single cheese burger protein style a order of fries and a ice tea. Now I don't eat there very often but when I took my first bite and looked at the burger I noticed it was only about 3/16 of an inch thick. It could of even been thinner. I went WOW where is the beef.(Sorry for using an over used term.) This was quite a bit thinner than I can rememberer. I know, I know, I know, if they had been that thin in the past I surely would of noticed. It was just a little thicker than peanut butter spread on a piece of toast. Guess I can blame it on the economy. Rocket Burger is at least 2 to 3 times thicker. Much better value. \nIf you go to In & Out, look at the patty. \n\nThis review is meant to inform. Not to be negative. Hopefully you do not take it as being negative.  In & Out is always clean, the people friendly and cheerful, the food was good tasting. \nThe reason for the 2 stars and not 3 was value. The people at the restaurant did everything right. \nHappy eating!", "type": "review", "business_id": "yyahaWDdm1Hes99IZkSJPg"}

The fact that their pancakes and their omelets are above-average sized doesn't make them great. In fact, I'd declare they're pretty mediocre, and I've eaten here several times.\n\nThere are quite a few things about OPH that irk me to no end, especially at the South Park location.\n\n1. Regarding their pancakes: yes, they're good pancakes. Best pancakes ever? Hardly. Don't get me wrong: if all I had to eat there was a stack of pancakes, I'd be satisfied. But when you hear friends and colleagues rave about OPH's pancakes, you're expecting to have your dirty, hole-filled socks knocked off. \n\nNot so much here. \n\n2. Their omelets are obnoxious-sized. Seriously. They look as if the line cook tried to shove an entire turkey inside a egg wrap. \n\nLook, I get that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. That doesn't mean I want an omelet the size of the Hindenburg. I'm not going to finish it. Hell, I may not even last 3 bites. I'm not fond of places that tend to overdo it when it comes to certain plates. \n\n3. In the 5 or 6 times I've eaten here, I've never been waited on by someone who didn't have a shitty attitude. Ask for extra syrup or butter, and they look at you as if you just asked if you could perform all kinds of illegal and immoral sexual acts upon their mother. Considering this is the Bible Belt, some of those acts would seem immoral here, but where I come from, that pretty much constitutes \"going to first base.\" But I digress...\n\nIn addition to shitty service is the lack of service to begin with. You get seated, and maybe, just maybe, your waiter/waitress will take a few minutes from bitching about how much they hate working here - and mind you, I worked my way through college as a waiter, so I sympathize with having to work a crowded restaurant - and maybe they'll realize your coffee's running low and pour you some. Or maybe they'll realize you don't have silverware...while your meal's on the table. You can't eat pancakes with your hand. I mean, you could, but that's barbaric.\n\n4. Speaking of coffee, their coffee is BRUTAL. A warm cup of water with a pathetic sprinkling of coffee grounds is NOT COFFEE. Then I realized they serve Royal Cup Coffee. This is the kind of coffee you serve to people you hate. Apparently, the management at OPH hates their customers.\n\n5. Speaking of customers, something about OPH seems to bring out the shitty in some customers. Apparently there's an addictive formula in their pancakes that makes some customers act stupid, although I seem to be immune. Every time I've gone to OPH, I've been seated next to patrons who speak too damned loud and want to share every excruciating detail of their lives, or behave towards their meal as if they'd just escaped from a chain gang and haven't eaten a meal in weeks. \n\nI know I pointed out the crap service, but nothing gets me as angry as a customer that treats a waitress like shit. Dressing down a waitress because she forgot to bring you your egg whites is uncalled for. And the behavior some patrons demonstrate here is a big reason why I won't return to ANY OPH, wherever, whenever. The joint seems to bring out a giant stack of stupid in people.\n\nThere are better places in town for breakfast. \n\nThe thing is, the existence of an establishment like OPH proves the incestuous relationship that takes place between \"well-established\" restaurants that are merely coasting by based upon past glories and name recognition, and a general public either too ignorant to know better, or one that simply doesn't care.", "type": "review", "business_id": "UzMMpUFwJhwUkHOyeXeWsQ"}

I will buy from Best Buy all my big purchases because they are very, very good in service.\n\nThis one on Marks and Sunset is not the creme de la creme unfortunately.\n\nService - I give this 2 star.  The guy at the front welcoming you is totally cool and makes  you feel welcome to the family!  I give him 5 stars. That is where it kinda stops and get's hit or miss. The entire on line order pick up section has DMV or government type workers. These deserve a 1 star. You get mediocre service and what seems to be poor training.  The staff at the customer service counter perhaps have watched too many zombie movies, I say 2 star.  This is unfortunate because any user of Best Buy will be at the Customer Service center at one point and this is where the service should SHINE.  Otherwise, the TV staff are fantastic, and so are the people around the iPad and tablets.  These people seem to really want to help  you  5 star here. .  The staff around the laptops, hmmmm not sure what is going on with that.  2 star here.\n\nProducts - 3 star - Love the selection. I am a huge Amazon shopper, but want to and do in fact support Best Buy because they go the extra mile to have the products on display. Totally cool to experience this.\n\na. Camera Selection - from point and shoot to DSLR, they have a very awesome selection of cameras, lenses and accessories. Not bad priced.\n\nb. Computers - Great selection on Apples, Mediocre on Windows. They have the latest and greatest, but not too many high end. In fact, I could not find any. Perhaps the demographics show that most people want only business or low priced laptops. However, if they can sell Apples, they should be able to sell more expensive PC and Laptops.\n\nc.  Tablets - The selection is totally amazing and you get to compare all!\n\nd.  Phones - This place is hopping. Plenty of action.\n\ne.  Satellite TV - Come on, why are doing this to us? This upsell is quite annoying.\n\nf.  Movies / Music - Great selection, but who buys this stuff anymore?\n\ng.  TV's - WOW, this is like a great selection, great service, and I tend to like the offerings here more than Costco or Sams Club. You get a different variety of the same brands. If you want the cheapest, the warehouse clubs are the best deal, however, if you want certain features, Best Buy is the place.  Unfortunately this Best buy does not have the Magnolia Home Theater Demo area and this is unfortunate.\n\nSince Best Buy is hurting economically, and since they are the main retailer of electronics with the other's out of business, you would think that they would differentiate themselves from the warehouses, Targets, Fry's and Walmarts.  Swimming in the ocean with sharks is not a way to survive.\n\nI will continue to support this Best Buy, but they gotta help themselves as well.", "type": "review", "business_id": "VfKnsgSf_fUh7lSgoqfx1w"}

Now I'll try and forget it all over again. I threw half of my bagel sandwich in the trash, it was so bad.\n\nFirst of all, I must confess that I'm not a fan of bagel sandwiches. I just don't understand the concept. Making a sandwich harder to eat, that's the idea? Um, okay. I'm simply a fan of regular ole bread. Biting into a bagel sandwich is difficult and messy and simply not that fun. Bagels are perfectly fine when toasted and smeared with cream cheese or butter, but not for sandwiches.\n\nSo anyway, my MACN Week special bagel sandwich was something called Chomolunga and it was terrible. The tandoori chicken was only warm and very chewy and generally unpleasant. The bagel was slathered in this artichoke/ricotta/chickpea/god knows what else mixture. The slop that was slathered on my sandwich was cold, and my chicken was somewhat warm. It's odd to have a sandwich that's both hot and cold. The flavors were not good and didn't mesh well. This sandwich was impossible to eat on so many levels. Yuck.\n\nMy companion ordered a bagel sandwich with an egg, cheese and whatnot on it, and she seemed to like hers fine. Her spicy pineapple-orange juice was disgusting, though.\n\nA woman came up to the counter while we were ordering to point out her sandwich was made incorrectly. The staff wasn't very apologetic.  In fact, all the people behind that counter seemed disgruntled and lacking in customer service skills.\n\nAlso, how are you supposed to know where to pick up your sandwich? There are people yelling out names in the kitchen area and sometimes the cashier will yell out your name. Confusing. And I reckon when it's busy, it's difficult to hear them call your name. There are better setups at just about every other restaurant in this city.\n\nAlso, the place was pretty dirty. Get those tables wiped off more promptly, folks. No one likes a sticky table full of crumbs. \n\nI did enjoy the pickle spear that came with my meal. It was strong and salty and made me wince. Delicious. If not for this delicious pickle, I'd probably be giving this place one lonely star.\n\nAll of my prior unpleasant visits came rushing back to me after today.

Then when he asked for drinks she snapped that we needed to use the waitress. My husband stopped her from walking away and explained the situation. He ordered me water and then asked about the draft selection. She quite rudely directed him to read the signs. I was appalled. Not knowing I'd heard (heck everyone could hear) he came over to see me. At that point we decided to leave. \n\nIf you're a local, go here and enjoy. If not, good luck getting service at the bar. A table might work, but locals will still win.", "type": "review", "business_id": "51QMwutUI352Gmb3t1aryw"}

If there is one word to describe the meal it would be BLAND BLAND BLAND.

We went with the Waygu tasting menu when I asked about a wine pairing they said to pick any \"flight\" of wine that was offered because they would all go with the meal. Having had many tasting and degustation menus at many other restaurants I was very surprised by this, there was always a certain wine for each course not a \"one size fits all\" mindset. We decided to opt out of the wine flights and stick with mixed drinks.  Our first course was Lobster Bisque which was thin and barely room temperture and as we started to eat that, out came the salads, Caesar, Heirloom Tomatoe, and Buffalo Mozzarella again all I can say is BLAND BLAND BLAND no taste or seasoning what-so-ever. Now I was begining to get really worried about our main course and I was right to worry. The steaks, while cooked fine were as tasteless as everything else, and keep in mind that all of this was served to us with-in 30 minutes of seating down. When you go out for a meal like this is \"supposed\" to be, I don't expect to be rushed in and out the door. There were plenty of empty tables so it's not like they were busy. Anyway, I was so dissapointed in everything that after one bite of the steak my husband and I both decided to send it back. To the restaurants credit they did take it back and offer to make us something else but we just asked for our check and left. They did not charge us for the meal, just the drinks we had.

It was obvious he wasn't much of a people person as it took him about five minutes to acknowledge me by setting down the menu in front of me while he finished a conversation over the Bob Cat's game with a passing server by yelling through me.\n\nI ordered a beer and opted for a Chicken Caesar salad and a six pack of boneless habanero bbq wings (reasonably healthier than what  my guilt free conscience would order).  The order took about 20 minutes, but I was occupied with the big screens behind the bar.  After my food arrived, I closed my tab and headed back to the hotel with the food and was back in no more than five minutes.  When I opened the containers, I was surprised by how poorly my order was executed.  I ordered wings with celery and ranch, but what I received was french fries and blue cheese. Okay, no big deal.  Looking at my wings, it looked like they gave me way more than what I ordered so that made up for the error...but after biting into the wings, the breading was so thick, it practically overwhelmed the chicken.  They were also very sparing with the sauce on the wings, so it made for a very dry crunchy bread bite.  Since I received fries I figured I might as well enjoy 'em.  After a few, my taste buds were locked on a flavor of Salt & Pepper UTZ chips (a personal favorite).  \n\nMoving on, I decided to check out my Chicken Caesar salad.  I popped the container open and on first inspection everything looked fine, but I thought they forgot to include a container of dressing to accompany it.  Wrong!  They pre-dressed the salad and by the time I opened it, everything from lettuce to croutons were beyond savings from absolute sogginess.  The chicken was spared though as they grilled it above and beyond, resulting in charred-dry chicken strips.  \n\nOverall, not impressed.  Food can be easily fixed, but the service will require bigger strides to improve customer satisfaction by doing things right and respecting the customer. My realistic rating is 1 & 1/2 stars culminating from service experienced, mistakes on my order  and food execution flaws.", "type": "review", "business_id": "paR-TLy42ZmBWhahAxCWAw"}

I checked Yelp and found this place. There was a Yelp deal going on so figured we'd try it out despite some very negative reviews. So my boyfriend has his jersey on, he's all excited to watch the game, and when we get there, the place is PACKED despite it being 10am. Literally only two seats available at the bar. So we take them. Despite the many TVs, there was only one showing the Pats game which was all the way across the room and not viewable from our seats. We decided not to order anything without first making sure we could watch the game since that was WHY we were there. We spent a few minutes trying to figure out if there was a TV nobody was watching. There ended up being two practically next to each other that had the same game on. Perfect! So we asked the female bartender if she could have the Pats game put on. Her answer was simply, \"I'm not sure.\" and she turned around and went elsewhere. No offer to find out for us or any other assistance. My boyfriend and I just looked at each other like, \"Okaaay... what do we do now?\" and we started debating whether to leave or not (we did buy the Yelp deal after all and the game had started). A couple minutes later the bartender came back and asked what we wanted to drink. We explained that we weren't going to stay if we couldn't watch the Pats game. I asked her once again, if there was any way we could get a TV tuned in to it. She pointed at a rather intimidating looking man with grey hair which I assumed to be the owner by the way he was walking all around the dining areas. \"You can go ask him.\" Great... I was actually dreading this because I read in a previous review that the owner was not very  accommodating with customers (and my boyfriend was too shy to go ask). So I moseyed on up to him and *gulp* asked. He gave me a sour look and thought for a moment, but didn't say no. He held up his finger and said, \"We'll see.\" as he went into a back room. Good sign... I think? So we're sitting there with our fingers crossed, and finally the game comes on! It was bizarre how grateful we felt being \"allowed\" to watch a game at a sports bar! The food wasn't bad by any means, but nothing to write home about. I recall the draft beer selection not being all that awesome, so I stuck with my good ol' stand-by... Guinness. I will say that the male bartender that day WAS very friendly and welcomed us as newcomers (even though it was after we asked for the check). He just may have saved the experience and we might give this place another go.", "type": "review", "business_id": "pDXv67UQjBKScEgGhc5yLg"}

I have been sick with severe allergies and bronchitis for well over a month and can't seem to see a physician in this or the Mesa office, because they are TOO busy.

A PA does not even have to have a degree, and I am somewhat put off by a physician that has several PA's, for which doctor time is billed, yet there is never a physician available to see you when you are sick. Perhaps no one has realized that you can't book in advance for an illness that is not chronic. I have seen the PA's, and they are always in a hurry, therefore errors are made. Today I called, because I am getting worse once again, and was told I can come in next week when the doctor has openings, or see a PA. PA= not getting better, not sending in the prescriptions that were supposed to be sent, or wrong prescriptions. The front office women are nice, as are the MA's. I even asked if I could go to the Mesa office. It is even more frustrating, because I came to Dr. Coury's  from an office that was always \"on top of it'.

I have no idea who they were making drinks for either, it was not anyone at the actual bar. Ha they were making drinks for no one, they were just practicing lol. Nice view from the balcony, and the bathrooms were pretty nice according to my husband. We didn't stay long. I gave my free drink tickets to a girl coming in on my way out, so at least they'd get used. My husband and I sat down at a slot machine close to the entrance and had a drink within a few minutes, and I didn't have to do anything ridiculous.

We googled free admission clubs and she picked this place because it sounded like an interesting spot. It was free admission for girls and $20 for guys plus there was free vodka drinks for girls until midnight so we figured, hey, why not! (When we got there, we all got in free because we were on the guest list.)\n\nAfter we checked in and got our wristbands/hand stamps, we walked down a wide, white hallway to the dancefloor. It was a site for sore eyes. I swear everyone and their mother--literally, old moms trying to relive their glory days--were crowding the dancefloor. There were far too many 30+ yr olds  and not enough 20-something's for my liking. I can't forget about the old pervy looking 40 yr old dudes trying to prey on the young. Definitely not my scene!\n\nAlso, the dancefloor was too small, the music was a mix of old and new hip hop and some reggaeton which was all good except the DJ would play a fast beat then immediately follow it up with a slow tempo song which completely slowed down my groove too quickly. Oh and my heels kept getting stuck on the floor because it was extremely sticky from all the drinks the hoochies and grannies kept spilling. Ew. Because of the mess, there were employees who constantly had to walk into the crowd and wipe the floors WHILE people were dancing. So tasteless, completely ruins the club atmosphere. \n\nAnother thing, there was no designated smoking area so everyone was just lighting up all over the dang place. I can tolerate some smoke but when it's in such a confined space with sweaty bodies bump'n n grind'n and poor ventilation, it begins to affect my breathing. Not cool PURE.\n\nMoving on to the bathroom situation. There are no easily visible signs or directions that lead you to the restrooms. I had to ask 2 people where the hell to go and it was like a journey trying to find it! You had to cut across the side of the dancefloor just to find some dark corner that finally leads to the bathroom. Good thing about it was the large counter and mirrors and the SPACE omg the space! was a relief from all the cramped dance floor. it was clean, the lovely lady even walked me and all the girls to the next empty stalls. That was great service! Too bad I couldn't say the same for the bar...\n\nThe free vodka drinks were weak, maybe that's why they were free. Also, the female bartender was curt and didn't even say hello. I bought 2 AMF's for $30. Steep prices but it's expected for a Vegas club, or any club for that matter. \n\nOverall, if you wanna dance and rub elbows with your granny and her 60-trying-to-look-21-year-old friends, go right ahead. The all too-bright lights will definitely highlight their \"good\" features. This is a definite SKIP IT!", "type": "review", "business_id": "f3EcPjqKftEznBSs2oQVRg"}

They bought a lot of Albertsons and Vons in Nevada and California. They bought a lot so fast at a short time, that they went bankrupt and have to close a lot of stores down. So within months, they were already a failure waiting to happen. The location at this place used to be Vons.

Vons had high prices but kept value all around and kept customers still shopping. Haggens was greedy and wanted more. Now management is just as important, but am sure corporate had much more to do with the failure of this grocery chain to thrive in such a beautiful heart location of Summerlin.

We presented our coupon upon receipt of our bill (The HOG $13; Salmon $19) to our server. Our server advised that the coupon should have been presented when we ordered. She went on to explain Salmon & Steak entrees were exempt from the coupon, therefore she could not accept it. Thus we had to pay full price for the second non premium  meal. We questioned her stating the second meal was less and we would still be paying full price for the salmon. She said it didn't matter, owner's policy was to not accept the coupon if any party ordered the salmon or steak.  We understand that rationale should both of us ordered premium meals the coupon could not be used. The owner's policy, as stated by our server, is contrary to the wording on the coupon nor is it noted on the menu or visibly posted in the restaurant.\n\nFriday's experience is in direct conflict from my visit, with several friends, to Ground Control in December 2014.  During that dinning experience we used the Entertainment Book coupon from the 2014 book.  We presented the coupon to our server, prior to ordering, and was not told of ANY menu exemptions.\n\nI'm writing this review to express my frustration with what appears to be an inconsistent application of Ground Control's coupon policy.  We enjoy patronizing this restaurant and have always had good food and service; however, Friday nights experience left us disappointed in Ground Control's customer service and public relations.", "type": "review", "business_id": "G1ub1s3EELLrGWqrq3a2tw"}

Maybe they just don't understand or are in educated on e CIGs but maybe time will change for them in the future for e CIG users.

I'm sure I lost some readers along the way but I can handle that.\n\nThe most unfortunate thing about this whole Bianco love affair is that the concept, building, and product are all excellent. The pizza is very good. The building is an amazing old brick structure that reminds me of my loft. The area is as beautiful as you will find in downtown Phoenix, surrounded by lush greenery, a garden, and tons of history. Waiting isn't even that bad when you consider Bar Bianco is full of the same character and spirit that the pizzeria is. I hate to hate Pizzeria Bianco...but I do.\n\nWe went a couple years back. We were going to a Dbacks game of particular importance (Dirty Byrnes t-shirt night) and decided we'd put our names in at Bianco's. The wait is usually 2 hours so that gave us plenty of time to watch most of the game. Around the 5th we decided it had been enough time so we headed over. The hostess told us it would be another hour or so.\n\nHmph....\n\nOf course we had no idea that the Oprah Show was doing a special on the restaurant this night so Gail is running around inside making a hell of a backup for the kitchen. Just our luck.\n\nAlmost two more hours later we were finally seated. Gail left a few minutes after that. We ordered the Biancoverde pizza (which was not green) and well, it tasted like every other wood-fired pizza I have ever had. The crust was charred on the bottom but the pizza was perfect. I'm not sure if brick ovens are outlawed in downtown, but I don't get the trend. In any event, as we were about to finish, Chris Bianco came over and apologized for making us wait so long, he paid for our dinner and bought us dessert. Awful nice for a guy who knows that every housewife within 3000 miles is going to be flying to Phoenix to wait four hours for his pizza.\n\nLike I said, I didn't hate it. But it wasn't worth 4 hours. It wasn't worth the original 2 but I had to see what the hype was about. I wouldn't wait longer than 40 minutes for Bianco's because, that is the longest you will ever wait at Cibo. You will have a similar experience for a similar price but you won't be starved when you finally sit down to eat.", "type": "review", "business_id": "VVeogjZya58oiTxK7qUjAQ"}

We're typically Venetian patrons, but its free so we figured what the hell, let's do it up.  We arrive and as we're checking in (2 guys, 2 girls), we pull off the the trusty old room upgrade gambit with a $40 tip.  The front desk guy gave us a wink and told us he'd take care of us with a romance package.  So we head up to our room feeling pretty good about it, and walk in to find a regular room puzzled by what he meant.  There was nothing out of the slight ordinary to suggest any romantic additions at all.  Not a single thing, not even robes.  Hell, even the Venetian leaves chocolates on your bed and a dim overhead light illuminating the bed with their regular turn down service -- none of that here.  Yes, Venetian has more romance offered on any given day than what I could make of this.\n\nThe room has 2 full sized beds.  Nope, not queen -- full beds.  Even Holiday Inn has queens.  Come on, Wynn, are you even trying?  It's okay, we'll request a roll-away and make due.  But I guess for the basic room we were in, they don't offer roll-aways because it violates fire code?  Room service was impressively bad except for the fries, which is pretty hard to screw up.  My friend couldn't finish a basic BLT sandwich even with her drunken appetite.\n\nThe girls that were with us thought we were just being super anal about everything because we couldn't stop making comparisons to the Venetian.  However, we ended up spending our last night in the Venetian and the Venetian converted them to fans with their rooms, food, and service within a couple of hours.  Then even they started echoing most of our Wynn criticisms.  Even though the rooms were free, it would have been more worth it to pay to stay at the Venetian.\n\nThey do have quite an awesome ice machine though, like seriously legit.", "type": "review", "business_id": "u9wjRhUjySkHPa_hG3kFOg"}

We finally decided that we had to try it to see how it stacked up against Kai, which is our favorite restaurant in the PHX area. I made reservations for Friday night of Memorial Day weekend a little over a week in advance. Since Binkley's is about 35 miles from the neighborhood that we both live in, we decided to make a weekend of it and stay at The Boulders. The week leading up to the meal, we were both so excited that we both joked that we were getting very little work done due to the anticipation of the amazing meal we were going to have on Friday night.\n\nFriday finally came and we arrived right on time for our 7p reservation. We were promptly greeted by the hostess and promptly seated at the absolute worst table in the house. It was in the bar area, right next to the front door. The most insulting part of it was the hostess tried to tell us what an amazing table it was because the vases of flowers that separated our table from the front door were so pretty. In the grand scheme of things, not a big deal if you wow us with the food. After all, we knew from many reviews that atmosphere is not the strong selling point of the restaurant.\n\nAfter we were seated, we waited for a good 15 minutes before being greeted by a server. This is one of my pet peeves in a fine dining establishment. I like to be greeted promptly by the server and offered a cocktail so I can enjoy a drink while reviewing the menu. Once we were finally greeted we ordered cocktails and enjoyed them when they were finally served. Being that this was our first Binkley's experience, we both decided that we would go \"whole hog\" and order the 6 course tasting menu with the $50/ea wine pairing. As has been mentioned in may other reviews online, a meal at Binkley's consists of a long parade of amuses. Sadly, in a meal of more misses than hits, the amuses provided more of the hits.\n\nThe big hit of the night was the summer truffle grits that the GF ordered as her hot appetizer. Both of us agreed that these were amazing. Unfortunately, most everything else was relatively forgettable (her halibut fish course was absolutely boring). My quail meat course was quite good, but not something that I would drive 35 miles to experience again.\n\nThroughout the night, the service and the pacing was uneven. Sometimes there was a very lengthy time between courses while other courses were brought to quickly. While our main server was perfectly friendly, she lacked fine dining polish and disappeared for long periods of time (especially when it was time for the check!) several times over the course of the evening.\n\nAs for the wine pairings, those were also hits and misses. The pourings themselves were quite anemic and with long times between courses, there were several times that I had finished my pour before the course even arrived. For a total of $100 between the two of us, I felt the wine was a weak spot in the evening.\n\nThe most entertaining part of the meal was the Gordon Ramsay-esque, f-bomb laced tirade that Chef Binkley went on at some point during the meal. Apparently his kitchen staff wasn't doing things his way and he was letting them know. Quite comical, although a little uncomfortable to other diners around as we could clearly hear every word that he screamed at his staff.\n\nWhen all was said and done, we spent a little over $400 with tip for dinner. While it certainly wasn't the worst meal of either of our lives, we both agreed that it didn't even come near cracking the top 20. We were both glad that we dined at Binkley's to have the firsthand experience, but we both left feeling that it was overrated. Perhaps they were having an off night, maybe it has slipped over the years, or maybe it's just a victim of being over-hyped. Whatever the case, I don't think we will be dining at Binkley's in the future.", "type": "review", "business_id": "yJMLD-6AggZNdC-GonVBsA"}

(www.dictionary.com)\nRevenge: 1: to exact punishment or expiation for a wrong on behalf of, especially in a resentful or vindictive spirit: \n\nThose are the two words: disappointment and revenge, that describe my current state of mind as I compose this review of Growlers Pourhouse in NODA.  I feel nothing but utter disappointment with every aspect of my experience at Growlers tonight.  I came home and instantly began writing this because I feel the need to exact some minor sort of revenge for the disappointment I felt, and paid for tonight at Growlers.\n\nThis is one of those rare experiences in which my feelings and rating for this place started high, but dropped the longer I was there.  I'll say it all started well, we came in, the decor of the place strikes you immediately.  This place has the feel of a classic English pub.  Not many television screens.  Not very big inside - essentially, its nothing more than one big room, with the kitchen being in the back.  \n\nIt took my buddy and I an unusually long time to place our orders.  He ordered the Cornbeef ruben, I ordered the wings with a side of ranch instead of blu cheese.  I know, I know, I should have gotten a sausage, but I had a bunch of brats, hot dogs and sausages yesterday on the 4th of July!\n\nThe meals arrived soon thereafter.  The first thing I noticed was that though the wings smelled great, they looked horribly under-sauced.  You know when you look at the wing and you see entire sides of plain, fried, chicken skin, well that my friends is UNDERSAUCED.  Problem Two: I was given blu cheese instead of the ranch I asked for.  Not only that, but it took a long time for one of the bartenders to come check on us and for me to finally receive a ranch.  Problem THREE: The wings were horribly overcooked or stale, or old or some combination of all three.  These are unquestionably some of the worst wings I have ever had!  Overcooked, dry, undersauced, not meaty, etc, etc, etc.  \n\nI wanted to go tell the cook back there, \"Hey! Listen buddy, you can't serve wings in this town that have been sitting under a heat lamp for five hours, NOT properly sauce them, charge $9 and call yourself anything other than a colossal disappointment!\"\n\nYou want more issues?  Well, you're in luck, because when we finally got our tabs, I was charged for a $5 Ruby Lager, when I order a $1 PBR!  Do you see what I mean about it getting worse the longer I stayed there?\n\nThis place was a total waste of $19.24 that I will never get back, or otherwise be compensated for.  I will never have the chance to personally tell the management how disappointing the whole experience was, mainly due to the fact that I will NEVER be back.  \n\nAll I could think as I was leaving was that I will have my revenge on YELP, in this review or the next...and for whatever its worth to you out there, I feel much better having shared my Disappointing experience with you.", "type": "review", "business_id": "o5Me8uSqyUSm8U3aEMAbSA"}

I understand this is more a bar scene thing, but seriously a hamburger and some fries should not take over three hours!!!\n\nAnd on top of this, the food sucks. we had gnocchi lightly fried, and kobe beef burger.\n\nThe gnocchi was a disaster, no sauce and cuz it's fried it developped a crust which made is hard and tough, not really a good texture for gnocchi. the Kobe beef burger was ok, not worth the premium of Kobe, and it came without ketchup, took another half an hour and asking three times before i got it. And the third time I asked, she just went behind the counter picked it up and brought it straight to me!!! the ketchup was prepped already just there to pick up and bring it, and yet it took a so much wrangling to get something...\n\nI usually don't give out 1 or 2 stars cuz I'm not out to put businesses down but this place just rubbed me wrong.", "type": "review", "business_id": "m1MYT40BfvKVHcYm1yhXew"}

I was working with Carlos and a manager by the name of Mary all day today to buy my daughter her first car.  I got pre qualified and told them I would be down as soon as my husband got home from work and would be there around 5:30 or 6pm.  I did ask them if we could put less down then they were asking, it's only normal to try to make a deal when buying a car! Anyways, instead of simply saying no they went ahead and sold the car right out from under us! Super crappy!! Needless to say my family will never do business with this dealership ever!", "type": "review", "business_id": "5TusB4C65bCOJ0C2PYZuEg"}
